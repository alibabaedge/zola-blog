<p>The hype around NFT is already subsiding, and sales of NFT images have come to naught. But is the technology of non-fungible tokens as useless as they say lately?</p>
<p>The most familiar tokens to us are subway cards. We buy a subway token to ride the subway. If earlier only states and large corporations could issue their tokens, now everyone can issue them within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different tokens. Management tokens, tokens for purchasing services and goods, music, works of art, and tokens for buying services and goods. In China, reputation is tokenized in the form of a social rating). Soon, all citizens will be tokenized with the introduction of state digital money (CBDC).</p>
<p><strong>All tokens can be divided into fungible and non-fungible, better known as NFTs.</strong></p>
<p>Fungible tokens are issued for identical goods or services that do not differ from each other. For example, there is a certain amount of tokens for taking the subway, and it makes no difference which token you use for this trip.</p>
<p>Another thing is non-fungible NFT tokens. They are usually released for something unique. It is generally viewed that NFTs are pixelated pictures people buy for crazy money. In fact, they are not. For example, we have a cottage village of 10 buildings. All houses were built using the same materials and a standard layout. But one home is located at the entrance to the town, and the other on the outskirts. One house faces the forest, and the other one the lake. In this case, for each house, it will be necessary to issue a separate non-fungible NFT token.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is that you can measure a person's reputation with the help of the NFT token. The reputation tokenization is inextricably linked with personality tokenization.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>For example, Rachel decided to become a programmer. For now she is not a programmer yet and needs funds for subsistence and training. Rachel can issue <strong>10,000</strong> tokens for her programs. At the presale, Rachel can sell her tokens for <strong>$10-$20</strong>. But after some time, when Rachel becomes a high-class programmer, her services will increase in price and be estimated at <strong>$100-200</strong>, depending on how well she masters programming languages.</p>
<p>If Rachel fulfills the obligations on the tokens, her reputation will grow. And in case of failure to fulfill the obligations, it will accumulate a vast negative reputation. This will make it clear to others whether to have business with Rachel or not.</p>
<p>NFTs are tightly integrated into our lives, and most likely, the world around us will soon be tokenized. Driver's licenses, real estate rights, art, and even pets.</p>

<p>What is a smart contract? Let's first see how a regular contract works. Two parties, A and B, want to conclude a contract. They need the services of a third party they can trust to keep up with the contract. Smart contracts eliminate dependency and enable the automatic execution of contracts. A smart contract is nothing more than a programmable behavior of the chain or even simpler, its a programmable behavior.</p>
<p>If we compare ordinary and smart contracts, smart contracts have apparent advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Regular contracts require:</strong></p>
<p>• A third party you can trust.
Usually, lawyers, notaries, and the government enforces the contract.</p>
<p>• Time.
Manually executing a contract can take a lot of time.</p>
<p>• Money transaction
In conventional contracts, the transfer of funds is carried out manually, which adds more time to the final execution of the contract.</p>
<p>• Transparency
Ordinary contracts cannot provide 100% transparency, because their clarity largely depends on the contract's third parties, intermediaries, and institutions involved.</p>
<p>• Storage
The storage of contracts is usually a large and complex problem since most transactions are recorded on paper, and all records are stored in physical form.</p>
<p>• Expenses
Traditional contracts require more expenses to pay for the services of intermediaries. </p>
<p><strong>When using a smart contract:</strong></p>
<p>• There is no third party to trust.
A smart contract is executed automatically and does not require the involvement of intermediaries.</p>
<p>• Time
A smart contract is executed quickly, in minutes, when the specified conditions occur.</p>
<p>• Money transaction
In smart contracts, all conditions are predetermined and set in advance. As soon as the condition is met, the transfer of funds is carried out automatically.</p>
<p>•  <a href="https://etherscan.io">Transparency</a>
100% transparency around the clock. Any party can view the terms and transactions of the smart contract.</p>
<p>• Storage
Smart contracts do not require paper storage and allow you to instantly track the entire history of the fulfillment of the terms of the contract and transactions.</p>
<p>• Expenses
Smart contracts offer <a href="https://www.ethgasstation.info">low commissions</a> because they do not require intermediaries to execute them. Only the commission of the leading blockchain network in which the smart contract is implemented is charged.</p>
<p><strong>What is a smart contract?</strong></p>
<p>Let's take an example from real life. You want to buy chocolate from a vending machine. You put a bill into the machine, press the button with the number of the chocolate you want to buy, and the machine gives you that particular chocolate. A smart contract is very similar to a vending machine. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and replaces the vendor.
A smart contract is a self-executing contract that contains all the terms and conditions between the parties and participants of the agreement. The terms and conditions of the agreement are written in code that runs on a decentralized blockchain platform. Such agreements govern digital assets, shares, property, currencies, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Let's take another example.</strong></p>
<p>Rachel arrived at the airport, but her flight was delayed. However, this inconvenience can benefit Rachel, as according to the smart contract with the insurance company, she will instantly receive compensation for the delayed flight. Imagine that there is already a smart running contract with an insurance company. This contract tracks delayed flights, and as soon as the delay is more than 2 hours, all insured persons, including our Rachel, automatically receive compensation in their account.
Let's see how it works.
An insurance company issues its clients a smart contract on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum blockchain</a>. This smart contract is connected to airport databases and keeps track of flight delays. If any flight is delayed by more than X hours, automatic compensation occurs, and Rachel gets the money into her account.</p>
<p><strong>What are the bottom-line benefits of smart contracts?</strong></p>
<p>• No intermediaries
The advantages of smart contracts include the absence of the need for intermediaries and a third party.</p>
<p>• Automation
The smart contract is executed automatically. All terms of the contract are written in the code. So you don't need to do anything manually.</p>
<p>• High speed
The absence of intermediaries and the high speed of calculations make it possible to execute a smart contract quickly.</p>
<p>• Safety
The contract data is stored in a decentralized system and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>• Accuracy
Depending on the terms and conditions of the contract, the requirements for its implementation are prescribed with high accuracy. All transactions are recorded in the blockchain ledger and become immutable. No one can edit or make changes to these entries.</p>
<p>In what areas do you think using smart contracts will be helpful?</p>
