<p>[00:00:00] Citizen Cosmos: Good space-time ya’ll! Welcome to the new Citizen Cosmos episode, and today we have Willy Ogorzaly with us, the head of the decentralization at the ShapeShift DAO. Hi!</p>
<p>[00:01:33] Willy: What’s up, everyone? How are you?</p>
<p>[00:01:37] Citizen Cosmos: Great! How are you? How is the sunny state of Colorado? </p>
<p>[00:01:39] Willy: It's a sunny day out here, I'm having the best day ever so far. What about you? </p>
<p>[00:01:44] Citizen Cosmos: Good, also sunny. So, ShapeShift. So much noise, so many years, such a big project. Do you want to maybe introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about what you, what does it mean to be the head of decentralization?</p>
<p>[00:01:59] Willy: I've been part of ShapeShift for almost four years now, and I had the pleasure of being a part of it when it was a centralized corporation then, last year in July, we announced that we're becoming a DAO, and over the next six months we worked on transitioning from a centralized corporation to a DAO. Employees were let go in three waves, and meanwhile, we were building up the DAO deploying work streams. Things have been going well, we’re about nine months into this DAO journey. The Shape has pivoted a bit so when we first started in 2014, we were the first non-custodial exchange where you could trade crypto across chains from your own wallet rather than depositing it onto a centralized exchange. It started right after the Mount Gox fiasco. It was built as a solution to having to deposit funds onto a centralizing exchange and give up trust, so we were doing cross-chain trading before d5, before DeX, and before Ethereum. So when we saw the advent of these decentralized exchanges, we were impressed and realized that these decentralized exchanges were doing a better job at ShapeShift’s original vision and that way to do this was to decentralize protocol so that you could list any new token as soon as it came up and be permissionless so that people could come to list their own tokens. We embraced these decentralized exchanges, integrated the DeX and Etherium, we integrated Thor chain the day that they launched mainnet. The day that we integrated Thor chain, we sunset our own trading desk, so now you can think about ShapeShift as a free open source community-owned and soon decentralized interface between users private keys and
decentralized protocols. We support multiple wallets, we support multiple chains, and we support multiple protocols on those chains. Now, you can come and buy, sell, receive, trade, and the yield on cryptos on 11 different blockchains.</p>
<p>[00:03:42] Citizen Cosmos: And it's all non-custodial, right?</p>
<p>[00:03:45] Willy: Yeah. Non-custodial is our core value. We’re all about financial sovereignty, and another one of our core values is the multi-chain future we've always believed in Shape. We love Etherium, we love Bitcoin, we love Cosmos, and Shape is the interface where you can do things on all these different chains and even across chains.</p>
<p>[00:04:03] Citizen Cosmos: Tell me about the journey. In crypto, a project that has worked for 8 years now, that’s like history. How was this journey for you personally?</p>
<p>[00:04:18] Willy: For me personally, it's been an awesome journey, and we've been through several market cycles. We've seen a lot of ups and downs. My first experience with ShapeShift was in 2017 when my friend showed me an easy way to trade, and I just thought it was so cool I've always liked altcoins and cool visions, so I'm always looking for the next hot thing, and so at the end of 2017 I  started a company called Bitfract, and it was the first tool where you could trade Bitcoin for multiple cryptocurrencies in a single transaction. It was built on top of ShapeShift, you could buy any of the tokens or coins that ShapeShift had supported, and you could choose what percentage you wanted of each coin, send in Bitcoin, and then we’d use ShapeShift to execute trades and then send all the crypto to you whatever addresses you had put. That was a pretty awesome experience and six months after we started that, ShapeShift acquired Bitfract and we were brought on to a team to build a new version of ShapeShift. This is the time when ShapeShift was realizing that the original exchange model had regulatory issues with it and we came to the conclusion that we needed to implement KYC to continue offering trading functionality. Before KYC ShapeShift was the leading way to trade crypto non-custodial and after we implemented KYC we lost a lot of our users and our volume and our revenues. A lot of our existing users started in even wallets that had integrated ShapeShift to power their trades and didn’t want to start requiring KYC so they implemented a lot of the copycat projects that had kind of done the same thing that ShapeShift had done but without requiring KYC. That was a tough couple of years. We had
to spend months building this KYC functionality and not only into our products but into our organization bringing on compliance teams. So that was a lot of effort that really ended up hurting us more in the long run and I wish we could go back in time and just realize that we should just stop the trading thing now, we shouldn't go down this centralized route, we should instead start embracing these decentralized protocols even though the centralized exchanges weren't quite feasible yet. That was one of the challenges. We didn't have the option at the time to just plug into these centralized exchanges because they hadn't been built yet. So retrospectively that was probably not the right decision but at the time there were reasons that it made sense for us to make that switch at the time. Once we saw the decentralized exchanges actually working and able to handle the liquidity and the volume that we had with our users, we immediately integrated them. Since then things have been going great, we were able to remove KYC which made our product better. Now, as a DAO, things are going better than ever. Some of the differences before ShapeShift got decentralized, we were closed source so we could only build however much as we had internal bandwidth to build and there's so much to build in the cryptocurrency world. We wanted to integrate all these protocols, all these chains we were always limited in how much we could prioritize. Also, things were pretty secret at ShapeShift. We had a big separation between the internal employees and team and our actual users in the broader community and I always hate it. We'd be working on cool stuff but I couldn't talk about it at conferences, I couldn't tell anybody about it until it was live. Now everything is open, we have public meetings every day in the discord and anyone can just come in and hang out which is really awesome. I like being able to be just fully transparent and it's powerful because now we have the support of the community in ShapeShift. we have such an awesome community because we have been around for so long. We’re a recognizable brand and we recently deployed an airdrop after a million users joined us. One of my favorite parts about the DAO is just the awesome power of the community builders all around the world coordinating every day and coming up with cool ideas, sharing their unique perspectives to achieve this vision and we are now moving faster towards this vision. We're spending less than we did at a centralized company, we're earning more revenues and this is nine months into it so we're just getting started. </p>
<p>[00:08:17] Citizen Cosmos: This is fantastic! We’re all here to see how products progress from centralization to decentralization. In your opinion, how should the applications be launched in Web3? In decentralized manner or start centralized and move towards decentralization? </p>
<p>[00:08:55] Willy: It's a really interesting question! I'm a big fan of decentralization. I think the sooner you can get to that the better. When ShapeShift started it wasn't possible to be a decentralized organization. We had no choice. But if I were starting a new project today I would absolutely push to start it as a DAO because once you do start it as a centralized organization, then it's more difficult to transition to a DAO. With a Shift, it was pretty interesting though. Huge props to Eric and John for getting our shareholders on board with the idea of transitioning to a DAO. There were some advantages. The fact that ShapeShift had been around for a while, we weren't just starting from scratch we had a community, not just our internal employees who all knew each other and worked together well but also our users, so I think that was pretty advantageous and we were able to do a lot of work as a team internally to then launch the DAO successfully. We were able to build the DAO stack, build the governance process and gift it to the community. I talked to a lot of people now who are working on new projects and I encourage them to go the DAO route because it will pay off in the end. I also think progressive decentralization is important. You don't have to start day one being fully decentralized -  it is difficult, right now there aren’t many tools where you can do everything you need to do as an organization in a decentralized way. But as long as you're progressively getting more decentralized and as long as you're transparent with your community about where points of centralization are, then I think that's fine and you can work together as a community to address each of those points.</p>
<p>[00:11:02] Citizen Cosmos: As somebody who has already been through the whole journey of going from a centralized to a centralized company, what would be your number one advice to those who have already started doing their projects but not in a decentralized way? </p>
<p>[00:11:24] Willy: I think it's a challenge when you want to launch your DAO but you want to make sure that you're ready to launch the MVP and ideally an MLP. You don't need to have everything figured out as long as you have that core framework where people can come in and pass proposals and start contributing and coordinating. That's a great place to start and once you have that, you need to some dank memes. You need to make it really clear what your DAO is about, and why anybody who hears about your DAO should be interested and get involved. How can you distill that into a really clear and like Bitcoin. ShapeShift is like the one-stop shop for cross-chain DeFI. I think we still need to work on that mem so it's catchy.
From that you know you can have all the actual cartoons and pictures and funny stuff that go
viral and capture people's attention but that's so valuable because the DAO is all about the community and so you need to start building that community. I also had experience working with Giveth. That was amazing to see unfold in real life when people all around the world just
come join the community and say they believe and share the same vision. It's so powerful and you need to make it really clear to somebody why they would want to get involved with your community and then make it easier for them to onboard. Think about the user experience of like somebody who actually then lands in your Discord, they land on your form, how can you make it really easier for them to get engaged start contributing and then reward them with your governance tokens? You can figure out that cycle where people can hear about your DAO, get involved, become owners, and contribute and add value. Then you're off to a great start and the rest can just be built by the community.</p>
<p>[00:13:14] Citizen Cosmos: In your opinion, is a DAO suitable for any type of product? Let’s say podcast? What would DAO do in a podcast? </p>
<p>[00:13:25] Willy: I like to think that DAO really can apply to just about any business. First of all, DAOs can be designed really however you want. They can be flat, they can have a hierarchy. When you can have a podcast company with shareholders or a podcast DAO and bring each of your guests, you can give some tokens so that they have an owner in your DAO. You can create just about any kind of business, any organization, you can either do it with a bank account and with a legal entity or you can do it with a treasury on a chain. It now makes the most sense for these digital communities or technology software companies or protocols, but I don't see any reason why it's in the future it's not going to be easier to start a DAO. With a DAO, you’ll be able to do all the things you can do as a centralized corporation except for having bank accounts and can't sign contracts but everything else you can do. There’re multiple things you can do with DAO. Why would you start an LLC if you could just go online? </p>
<p>[00:14:30] Citizen Cosmos: I really don’t understand why anybody wants to start LLC. That’s crazy. You have a good point. The idea of minting NFTs and giving the to guests and then listeners has been on my mind for a while. I have a slightly different question. What is the future of DAOs? Where are we headed? What’s it going to be in 5 years? </p>
<p>[00:15:12] Willy: I think we have barely begun to scratch the surface of like what's possible with DAOs and you can just see where DAOs are today and where they were a year ago or two years ago. It comes so far, and they're continuing to innovate, and now the pace of innovation is accelerated because there are all these real doubts that need solutions. There's a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to build these solutions. I think we're just getting started, and what we’re making at ShapeShift we’re solving most of the relevant problems. Our goal is to dissolve ourselves, and we will do that once ShapeShift is completely decentralized, and there's no need for the illegal entity, no central points of failure. Our mission is to remove all the central points of failure, and replace them with decentralized alternatives so that we can dissolve ourselves and pass complete control over to the community.</p>
<p>[00:16:30] Citizen Cosmos: It's interesting you mentioned values goals. What was the original motivation for ShapeShift to be created? And what is the big goal of the DAO right now?</p>
<p>[00:17:20] Willy: I would say we stayed true to our values from day one and the core values that were founded on financial sovereignty enabling financial sovereignty for billions of individuals across the world borderless, unstoppably, trustlessly. I think we've done a great job sticking to that, and people also always believe in this multi-chain future where there's value beyond Bitcoin, beyond Ethereum, and that if this feature is going to exist, then there should be a way where any individual can access this feature in a way where they're not giving up custody or trust or they can't be censored or stopped. So I  think that’s cool because the industry has evolved around us and so the way that we've tried to tackle that vision has evolved absolutely. Now, we are embracing just all of these decentralized protocols that new ones were getting built every single day, and I just think that's so cool. It’s hard for me to imagine a more important mission. If we can enable that and bring that to the masses, that is going to have more of an impact on society than anything else that I can think of. You can have all these cool decentralized protocols but if the actual interfaces themselves or if they back in the blockchain data the user needs to be able to access this itself decentralized and we can't really enjoy this decentralized future. So ShapeShift is in a great position to solve that because we've been running nodes interacting with these chains since 2014. We have a ton of experience doing this and doing it in a noncustodial way. Not only do we have this amazing team that's been working at ShapeShift for eight years but we've got this awesome community. Now that we’re open-source, we’ve been putting bounties on GitCoin, and ShapeShift is now a top project on GitCoin for putting bounties out. </p>
<p>[00:19:30] Citizen Cosmos: This is so cool, man! I didn't know that ShapeShift was the number one project offering tasks on GitCoin. What is now the main goal of the DAO except for financial sovereignty?</p>
<p>[00:19:59] Willy: If you go to app.shapeshift.com, you could see the new Cosmos functionality. It's beautiful, it's super easy to use, and they're no fees added ever so you can think of us as an aggregator. We build really great UI/UX, and you can come to apps.js.com, buy, sell and receive and yield in crypto all for free and across chains. So our trade page it looks a lot like uni spot where you can trade one asset for another and put the amounts
but it's also got a Thor chain in that same interface. Not only can you trade all the Ethereum assets but you can also trade Ethereum for Bitcoin. The way we're building all this, too is with abstraction layers so that we build one UI/UX. We're constantly optimizing that and then any protocol that shares that same UI/UX, which is like a lot of the trading protocols like an exact lot of lending protocols, the same a lot of the single asset staking yield protocols. You approve the token, you choose the amount you deposit, and you see numbers go up, so the way we are building things is so that once we build this UI/UX, it's very easy for other protocols to integrate themselves. For example, the first yield generating protocol we integrated was yearned, and right now we're working on the abstraction layer, and we have idle finance ready to come to integrate them or put a bounty up to get integrated, and we're actually going to partner with them on this bounty. They're going to put up half the funds from their treasury, we're going to put half the funds from our treasury, and then anyone in the community who wants to come to integrate idle can just come to plug it into our existing UX/UI. Now that we have Cosmos support, it’s very easy for us to support all the Cosmos zones. There's a bounty also up from Osmosis, this is another joint bounty from the Osmosis
community to get integrated into ShapeShift, and this is in progress. and now that our Cosmos support is much easier for us. Soon, Osmosis will be sending, receiving, staking, trading and liquidity providing, and bonding. Then we want to support all the Cosmos zones. If you're Cosmos dev listening to this, come integrate yourself into ShapeShift or come put a bounty you have to get integrated. The other reason I'm excited about is bridging. Enabling bridging between Etherium between Cosmos so that in one place, you can connect your Keplr,  your metamask, or you can connect the ShapeShift wallet, and it supports both. All free, open source, and soon - fully decentralized. </p>
<p>[00:22:32] Citizen Cosmos: This is my next question. When are we going to see foxchain on Cosmos?</p>
<p>[00:22:39] Willy: If you guys haven't heard about fox chain it is the new Cosmos zone that's under development and collaboration with ShapeShift, and we're also working with coinbase cloud on building this out, and they've been awesome. Shout out to coinbase cloud team. It's in the early stages of development; we're in like the research phase right now so we're kind of designing all the protocol, we're doing models, and stuff with tokenomics. Basically, what a fox chain is, it's a network to incentivize node operators to provide blockchain data to end users. We need this for ShapeShift to be decentralized. We've always operated the nodes ourselves, but we need in order to fully decentralize and for the foundation to dissolve we need to have another source of blockchain data, ideally a decentralized source. That doesn't exist yet so what fox chain does is incentivize node operators to run nodes for any blockchain they want to run notes for it and then get rewarded in fox tokens. We need it for ourselves, but any DAO that actually wants to be decentralized and not just run their own nodes can plug into fox chain to get the blockchain data they need for their users. We’re expecting in to launch in early 2023. </p>
<p>[00:24:40] Citizen Cosmos: When are you planning to launch the first test net for validators to come in already? Is there going to be an incentivized test net before it goes live in 2023? </p>
<p>[00:24:46] Willy: I'm sure there will be a test net, and I  think hopefully, once we complete this research phase will have a better timeline for when that could be available.</p>
<p>[00:25:00] Citizen Cosmos: So the most important question - when airdrops of the new fox chain? </p>
<p>[00:25:02] Willy: That's what we're figuring out right now</p>
<p>[00:25:08] Citizen Cosmos: I see. So basically, is there any alfa? Should people go and buy more fox tokens now on Ethereum to get more airdrops in the future or not?</p>
<p>[00:25:18] Willy: I think I'm not supposed to say anything about that.</p>
<p>[00:25:20] Citizen Cosmos: I know, but still, I’m looking forward to that because. I have a controversial question. It’s a made-up story. You said that you know the first day you started working in ShapeShift there was the whole thing with the introduction of the KYC. Obviously, now things have changed, and things have progressed again. Who is to say that the foundation is still there or some of the company is still there, and something bad happens like the authorities would come and ask for the valuable data? Is there a possibility of it, considering there was such an incident already?</p>
<p>[00:26:22] Willy: As a foundation, we don't have that data so we specifically made sure that we receive the data necessary to continue operating ShapeShift legacy infrastructure until we could send, edit and migrate all of our users to the new open source which doesn't require KYC, doesn't have any tracking. The KYC laws require you to keep the data for five years after collecting it. But ShapeShift is required to keep that data but right now is pretty much operating in a skeleton mode. Almost all the employees have moved on and there's just a small skeleton group that's keeping ShapeShift alive basically for tax purposes this year and maybe just to like to be the custody of that data which is all encrypted, stored offline in cold storage. The data that we didn't want to collect but had to. We followed the rules. Fortunately, there was no reason for the foundation to receive this data because we don't need that to continue operating ShapeShift, so we specifically made sure that we didn't
have access to the data, so if the regulators come to ask us for it, we can’t give it to them which feels pretty good. </p>
<p>[00:27:28] Citizen Cosmos: I understand what you mean -  the less you know, the better you sleep. What is, in your opinion, the future of KYC and web3? </p>
<p>[00:27:48] Willy: I am excited for civil tools like the ability to know that an individual address is a real person. As long as users are in control of the data, they can choose whether or not to share their data. I think it's a much better status quo than we have right now and especially if there's options to do the thing that you want to do in finance without being required to share that data. Then I think that's a better world. I personally think that KYC is kind of ridiculous: requiring people to give up all their private information when normally it's like innocent until proven guilty, but here were assuming people are bad actors, and then it's a bad risk it's like we're just a honey pot. All this data that time and time again is going to get hacked, so I'm excited about the potential for web3 to enable users to at least have control over their data. I do think that there probably will be on-chain KYC types of things that do get built, and I probably won't myself use them. Maybe there are some benefits, maybe 
there's no potential for benefits, maybe it's possible that the people can come up with reasons. I don't think it needs to exist, and I believe in free sovereign finance, and we don't need KYC for that, so it will be interesting to see how it all plays out. These KYC protocols will get built, and some projects will choose to implement them and require them, and whether or not those projects can compete with the decentralized alternatives that don't require that, it's hard for me to imagine we'll see what they can come up with.</p>
<p>[00:29:10] Citizen Cosmos: I have a slightly different question. When I go on your Twitter account, you have a .eth nickname and laser eyes. How does that work? You have to explain this one.</p>
<p>[00:29:45] Willy: Ethereum was what got me into the space for sure. It was the first crypto that I bought, but very quickly, I became a fan of Bitcoin and I have a lot of appreciation for Bitcoin I personally think that Ethereum will flip into Bitcoin but who knows what's going to happen I definitely believe in a multi-chain world. I think that's a good way to just show that. I love Ethereum, but I also like Bitcoin and am open to other chains. I reject tribalism, and ultimately I think the real enemies are the banks, the legacy centralized infrastructure, and the regulators but not each other. We're on the same team, and it hurts me to see that the
The bitcoin community is becoming so toxic and so maximalist. If the Bitcoin community continues going in that direction and Ethereum continues going in the same direction that is going, maybe I will get rid of the laser eyes.</p>
<p>[00:31:02] Citizen Cosmos: What is the value in your opinion of Bitcoin today?</p>
<p>[00:31:37] Willy: Before crypto, I used to like gold, so I really believe that fiat is the biggest evil, the biggest scam in history, and so I'm a big fan of hard money. I think Bitcoin is doing a  great job at solving that. However, it's possible that Ethereum is going to do an even better job. There's not a lot you can do with your Bitcoin right now, and I see the transact fees that Bitcoin is generating right now. I see how much it costs to secure the network, and the block reward is going down, and right now, it's not clear if Bitcoins' actual model is going to be sustainable. On Ethereum not only can you do anything and have all these decentralized finance protocols that add a lot of value and that people are paying a lot to use because it's worth it, but Ethereum can also be money. If you can have hard money that has a utility that people are willing to pay for and have a monetary model where it’s deflationary but
still sustainable, then that could be better than being sound money than Bitcoin, so I'm open to that. But right now, Bitcoin has a lot of liquidity, and it can still enable people to have financial sovereignty and to hold their own money and to send it to anyone across the world unstoppably, and so that's still very valuable I still think that's super freaking cool, and I appreciate everything that Bitcoin has done to enable what Ethereum and other blockchains are doing now.</p>
<p>[00:33:00] Citizen Cosmos: Yeah, I agree on most parts, though I’m not as enthusiastic about Bitcoin as you are, especially with all this toxicity. </p>
<p>[00:33:25] Willy: Actually, I got rid of my laser eyes a couple of days ago. I put a new picture. I did it because I didn't want my credibility to be hurt. However, I think Bitcoin needs to be worried because if Etherium can be better at being the sound money that right now they're, Bitcoin can’t compete. But Bitcoin has a strong community, they got a lot of supporters, and we'll see if they're able to survive I would be happy to live in a world where we have Bitcoin and Ethereum and they both co-exist. </p>
<p>[00:34:37] Citizen Cosmos: I have two more questions. The first one is more like a story about ShapeShift decentralization. How did somebody suddenly bring it on board? Can you deeper into the story?</p>
<p>[00:35:33] Willy: Shapeshift in early 2021 started going down this path. We could see a lot of the projects that were best achieving similar visions were structured as DAOs. A lot of the top DeFi projects were DAOs. I also had first-hand experience with the project for the hackathon, which was the DAO to save the world. We got first place and immediately afterward started building it, and we ended up joining forces with Giveth and building out the new version of Giveth. We built a DAO, we launched a token and built a community, and it was amazing to experience because I was able to do that in my free time. This was actually during the pandemic, so quarantine, lockdown, it's a perfect way for me to stay busy, so every week we're just having these community calls, and more people are joining the community. We built a beautiful product from scratch without any fundraising, just off of donations. That was pretty amazing to see when we were figuring out what is the best path forward for ShapeShift, and what's the best way we could achieve their dream. It was a heavy advocate for decentralization. We need to structure ourselves as a DAO, we need to drop fox tokens for all of our users and open source everything, and work with the community to build a community-owned interface to these decentralized protocols. At the
time, I was excited about this whole DAO movement. I think it's so freaking cool that you can have these community-owned products and ecosystems and not have to have a centralized corporation with a CEO.</p>
<p>[00:38:41] Citizen Cosmos: The last question is a traditional question. You are so alive, so energetic! What on Earth motivates you to keep on staying, apart from the decentralization and the value of the building? Is there something in your daily life that you could share?</p>
<p>[00:39:15] Willy: For five years now, I've been saying it's the best day ever, every single day, so I  kind of became known for that somewhat, and I love it. I think it's the right attitude to have. I love my job and the people that I work with. I'm passionate about what we’re working on, and it's fun. My values are to always, first of all, work on something you love, work with people that you love and stick to your values, and have fun! </p>
<p>[00:40:00] Citizen Cosmos: I like the number 1 rule; this is my biggest value. 
Thank you so much. It’s been a huge pleasure! </p>

<h2 id="transcript-of-the-episode">Transcript of the Episode:</h2>
<p>[00:01:32] Citizen Cosmos: Good space time you all! Welcome to a new episode of Citizen Cosmos, I have with me today two guests LTraveler and TravCrypto, community members of Idena. It's a Cosmos based project, they will tell us all about it, it's a very interesting project. Hey
guys! Whoever wants to introduce themselves first, welcome!</p>
<p>[00:01:58] LTraveler: Community knows me as LTraveler, I'm in the project for about two years. At the beginning why Idena catched me was getting into the crypto world without any penny in your pocket. It was pretty cool when someone asks me if I want to solve some puzzles and then get paid. I got joined into the community then I started to discover and when I went deeply I realized it's not just about to solving tests, it's actually something new that I have never seen
before. I have developed this script that helped people to run Idena on Linux server and then I have made my YouTube channel, I'm making some video tutorials that are explaining how Idena works and how it could help people to developed the fair democracy. Then I started to help with the translation of Idena chronicles and other materials from English to Russian and more and I felt like  we are building something that can make a revolution in the future. </p>
<p>[00:03:47] TravCrypto: Hey guys! My name is TravCrypto, I've been involved in crypto since 2016 and I started a little bit skeptical of crypto and what all it could really offer, and basically over time after  reading the Bitcoin white paper and other white papers like the Ethereum white paper I got really interested in blockchain technology and basically came across Idena because I wanted to participate in validation but other blockchains can be very plutocratic and can require you to have large amount of wealth in order to participate in validation so I wanted to find a layer one blockchain that anyone could participate in no matter how much wealth they had. That's how I came across Idena and I've been actively involved probably at least for the past couple of years and like LTraveler said the ethos is really really cool within the community because it's accessible to anyone and everyone, and that kind of brings us where we are today.</p>
<p>[00:04:57] Citizen Cosmos: I have several questions straight away. Which one of you guys wants to give a brief overview of what exactly it is and what is you guys doing? What is the
idea behind Idena? </p>
<p>[00:05:44] TravCrypto: Idena basically is a layer one blockchain but any human can participate in the validation. So the consensus mechanism is proof of person and unlike Bitcoin which is proof of work where you need ever growing amount of machines to participate or unlike what is soon to be Ethereum 2.0 hopefully if it ever happens proof of stake where you need an evergrowing amount of the actual cryptocurrency in order to stake and participate in validation,
you just need to be a human being and you need to participate in what's called a validation ceremony which currently happens approximately every three weeks and that validation ceremony is basically puzzles or flips proving that you're human. So you solve these puzzles over relatively short period of time and you prove that you're in fact a human, and once you do that you can participate in validation on the blockchain where you can earn mining rewards for validation. So that's the very basic overview and I think now LTraveler can probably dive into a little bit more of the technicality. </p>
<p>[00:07:05] LTraveler: So as TravCrypto said, we're developing the network that is going to be part of web3 and if we look on the process of participation to the network we can see that as a game. First, when you're just joining to the network, you’re just candidate and to protect our blockchain from bots we have created a system to invite new members only through the invitation codes so you cannot just come a candidate and join into the ceremony without invitation. First of all you are taking the invitation code then the person who invited you, he is getting rewards for the invitation so he's motivated to explain you everything clear and to control that you participate on time you know exactly what to do. So it's like your manager who's going to control you, going to check everything, who's gonna explain you the next step after the first validation. Then you're becoming from candidate to newbie and then you can have some new skills that you can do, so you can start mining if you want but the rewards that you are getting are going to the stake so you cannot just take money, you have to keep going. Then you're going for one more validation, you're getting a newbie 2 level but you still new so the money still
goes to your stake and only after third validation you are becoming identified member which gives you opportunity to invest your money into the stake, and why we are making that as I said because we are developing human blockchain like a blockchain for human being so we have to make the system that accepts humans but does not accept an AI or bots. I would like to tell you more about the process that is a part of solving - flips. The flip is a filter for intelligent people which means that when you're solving flips you can solve it because you are a human but the machine cannot solve it because the way how they made it which is a story with four images that has beginning and the end. we have four images in one colum and four images in another column and only one colum could be the order of image so the images are the same but the order only in one column can be represented as the story that had beginning at the top and the end of the bottom. So since you becoming a newbie, then you have one more responsibility. You have to create flips also and this is very important. It's like people are creating flips and people are solving flips and if we are talking about the validation ceremony, there are two parts. First part is a short session, it is one minute and forty five seconds why we have short session because the short session could guarantee that only one identity and one uman can be connected. It's like the period of the time is very short so you cannot pass validation from many identities which very important. Then we have the second stage and the second stage it's qualification session. The purpose of the long session is to check flips that have been created by other people, checking that all of the keywords are connected to the images and also that there are no marks or hints that help you to solve the flips. So we are moderators and also we are the people who are examinated by other identities. So we are like whole ecosystem that are
using our brain to support that blockchain, and this is more or less a general explanation.</p>
<p>[00:11:51] Citizen Cosmos: I like that. It's a very decent explanation easy to understand. I have more  questions, some of them devil's advocate, of course. So let's play a little bit with some of the things that you said. The first question which comes out to me is obvious: why human-only chain? Why Idena doesn’t recognize bots, machines, AIs as full-on intelligent beings capable of participating in life of the chain in an equal way to human?</p>
<p>[00:12:30] TravCrypto: That's a great question! My understanding is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism originally was one machine, one one vote or one node, so anyone could basically participate with their computer and they could validate on the proof of work blockchain which is known as Bitcoin and over time that's become more and more inherently difficult. I actually live in Texas, here in the United States and here are Bitcoin mining farms but hey're located all over the world and you can see how difficult that barrier to entry is for validating on this blockchain. To answer your question in terms of Idena being a proof of person chain or one person one vote as far as the consensus mechanism I think the whole idea is to have a more equal and egalitarian system that anyone in the world can participate in, and that's currently in place with Idena which is really cool to see because you can see people participating in the community. They’re participating in validation as well which is somewhat rare in other blockchains. Also to answer your question in regards to why can't AI participate, I think technically speaking they could participate if they were smart enough to complete the validation ceremonies which we haven't seen to be the case so far but I think technically speaking if AIs were as smart as a human being, smart enough to complete these flips as LTraveler was explaining previously, I think they very well in fact could participate butmthere's no AI that's currently at that technical level. </p>
<p>[00:14:27] Citizen Cosmos: So if I could summarize, it's not about disliking robots, you just think that at the current stage of the implementation that's a test for them. If they can solve it they can participate, that means they're smart enough. Is that basically what you're trying to get at? right</p>
<p>[00:14:42] TravCrypto: Right.The goal is to not have AI participate, that’s the ideal. We've been successful so far but obviously we hope that this validation ceremony can prevent AIs from participating in the future which allows humans to have the power in the in the consensus mechanism. There obviously have been a lot of attempts so far but they haven't been successful. </p>
<p>[00:15:09] LTraveler: There is one thing I would like to add is that there is a price for people who're going to develop that kind of system. So the developers going to pay amount of money for someone who's gonna hack the system.The second thing that we're always trying to predict that since the blockchain was released, it was already two or three additional protection have been implemented and we have to mention that first of all we call it antagonistic noise which is kind of noise that every image has and that protects when, for example, Google vision trying to check that kind of images with this antagonistic noise the percentage of correctly recognized images are very low. Also we have a mechanism when we are putting another image or another background with the low level of opacity, it could be noticed but it didn't break the general sense of the image. Also there is one more thing that sometimes the system when you are loading your flips it makes horizontal mirroring of the image just in case so all of that mechanism
are making for vision system very hard to ecognize images and to solve plays because
actually if that system going to exist then the whole blockchain’s going to be in trouble because it's just destroyed the whole system.</p>
<p>[00:16:55] Citizen Cosmos: I think it's a good cat and mouse game to see the improvement. It's like with bank security when the hackers hack the bank security, the bank security improves and so on and so forth. I think it’s beneficial for the whole industry what you guys are trying to do. </p>
<p>[00:17:10] LTraveler: I'm sorry that I'm interrupting but for us that kind of asystem that's going to solve flips automatically, it's like a person who can ray the money and the money are the same as the real money. That's why we are always aware of what's going on.</p>
<p>[00:17:27] Citizen Cosmos: Second question. It's going to be a bit unrelated to that but something I want to make clear. The proof of work and the proof of stake.  Can you guys clarify how exactly does it mix everything together? Where do the mining and the validation meet each other? I would love to hear it from you guys and to hear a proper clarification of where I'm wrong and where I'm not wrong.</p>
<p>[00:17:59] LTraveler: First of all, when you are joining to the network, your first validation ceremony is to pass the test. and since you pass the test then you can join to the mining but there is one very important thing of the mining that you don't need a powerful machine. You can use whatever computer or a virtual private server regardless of which operation system it is. We have a node client for Linux system, Windows and Mac OS. So, you can join and since you start to mine very important thing that the mining rewards are the same. There was recently a voting for the new hard fork and after accepting it, the new mechanism is going to connect the rewards for your mining and the amount of coins that you have in the stake. So basically what we are trying to do is not connect the mining process to the power off your machine. The only thing which is important if you're joining to the network, you're helping the network be decentralized as much as possible. But the main part is your brain, that you're a human and that you can solve and create good flips. Maybe TravCrypt wants to add something.</p>
<p>[00:19:32] TravCrypto: That was actually a great summary, I was pretty much going to say all of that same stuff myself. I just wanted to touch on a question that a lot of people typically ask as
well and it's all related to this. The question is why wouldn't I just complete the flips on 10 different computers, complete the validation ceremony with 10 different invitations and then I could get 10 times the amount of rewards or mining? Well, the answer to that question is this validation ceremony actually takes place at the same time all around the world so no matter where you live on planet Earth. This validation ceremony takes place all in sync all around the world. So obviously it's impossible to be in two places at once. Each person actually has to complete this validation ceremony on their own  personal device. You could do it on a mobile device, you could do it on a laptop but you complete this validation ceremony as LTraveller said in 1 minute and 45 seconds which is a relatively short amount of time, complete 6 different flips which are these puzzles. So it would be difficult to do that at the same time across 10 different machines. So that's how the network prevents people from having multiple identities for the consensus. It really sticks to one person one node. </p>
<p>[00:21:17] Citizen Cosmos: You mentioned plutocracy and at the beginning you said that the in Idena it almost doesn't exist and that's really cool to hear because in a lot of the times you come to a community and unfortunately what we see is centralization of stake and using that power to push opinions but a lot of the time it's not even that. It's really cool to see that it's the community members who are coming on to the recording to onto the podcast to talk about the project and to explain it other people rather than actually finding members. So the first question is why? How come it was community members that reacted? Why is it in your opinion like that?</p>
<p>[00:22:30] TravCrypto: Just from my perspective as a community member over the past couple of years first and foremost I think the developers of Idena are just very focused on the development of the blockchain and so they're the ones technically implementing these new bug fixes in these new editions that some other community members wouldn't be able to contribute and I think it's also this ethos of a community driven project.  The community is  now representing itself which I think is very unique to other blockchain projects. It's really cool to see because there's this ethos not only at the consensus level of one person one vote and participating in these different Idena improvement proposals like the most recent one IIP-5 where we're going to make a hard fork but also at this level right on podcasts. The community really is organized and representing itself which is pretty rare to see in the space.</p>
<p>[00:23:43] Citizen Cosmos: I have been in this industry for a long long time and I've seen projects fail and rise and one of the biggest reason proof projects fail is the lack of the community involvement, the lack of the community remembering that this is a decentralized space where that's what we're supposed to do. </p>
<p>[00:24:19] LTraveler: I think any project going to get success when you are always in touch with the community. The reason I like Idena because the developer is actually listening what the
community thinks, they are also in touch with us, they are checking discussions and so on and most of the improvements that  we have made it was because of the community feedback. For example we have had a hard time when we have had many really bad flips, we start to tell to the developers we have to do something with that because it's just the garbage and it couldn't be like that, and then there were lots of improvements. For example now we have a qualification part of the flip. It's like if you really like the flip you could put the star and then if that specific flip is going to get the majority. We have a filtration mechanism so you can approve flip, you can decline flip or if you do not have more reports, you can leave the flip as it is without any mark so that means that someone else from the committee where that flip goes to be examinated from other identities, if the flip is bad it's going to be marked as bad flip from someone else and
step by step people learning how to make good flips and how to report bad flips. So we're always in touch of course. We do not know each other in face but we're always talking, we're
always getting a feedback, there is always brainstorming. For example about IIP-5 there were a lot of discussions and then finally everything was integrated into the perfect wonderful solution. how to make solo miners, how to make them run independent. We have a huge pool and we want to be a network more decentralized so we have created a system how make people around their independent node to start mining by themselves and this is something unique that is happening in our community and I really love that.</p>
<p>[00:27:25] TravCrypto: Just to touch on that real quick, I think in other blockchains the like if you take the total community, the percentage of those community members actually participating in the validation is relatively small whereas Idena it's actually a very large proportion of the community so they have  more incentive to participate in these proposals, in these changes and and it's actually affect the rewards that they get so I think that incentivizes a lot of involvement within the community and it creates this environment where these proposals. There's really a lot of activity and it's cool to see all of the community proposals that people make.</p>
<p>[00:28:07] Citizen Cosmos: By the way proposals and IIP-5, it's about quadratic voting right? Does any of you want to explain what exactly it is and why you guys think it will help?</p>
<p>[00:28:39] LTraveler: Let's go back to the IIP-4 where we introducing the quadratic staking. So in the proof of stake systems we always have a problem: if you have a huge stake you're actually getting way more benefits comparing to people who have a small stake. The solution which we integrated in Idena blockchain is to make quadratic coefficient which is going to make the process of getting rewards for the staking in the way that if your stake is small you are getting more rewards the percentage of rewards out of your stake then more your stake than less the percentage out of stake you are getting. So that's how we making new members with a small stake for example earn rewards and also how we are making people with a huge stake also earn but with not a huge gap between people with a small stake. With IIP-5  we are getting a new idea about how to connect the stake and the mining rewards so the more coins you are putting into the stake the more rewards that you are getting from the mining process. Before we have had a huge cake of all rewards for mining and then we just spread all of that pie proportionally to each of the mining member so it was like each of the mining member get the same part of the reward. We have had a connection to the age of the identity so if your identity have had more ages when you are in the blockchain then you're getting more. So the newbies were getting less but it wasn't fair because someone came to the community two years ago and someone just now. So the people with more epochs in the block chain they're going to earn always more than the newbie members. The older the blockchain the more this gap is going to be so we completely changed the rule and now nevermind how old you are, the most important thing how much coins you have in the stake. So you have more coins your rewards are going to be bigger and also it is very good for the economy of the Idena because people are not going to exchange the coin after each validation. So the coin is going to be inside the blockchain.</p>
<p>[00:32:36] Citizen Cosmos: It's quite interesting that you use the same quadratic voting model because I've seen it implemented in airdrops a lot especially where you don't want the wells too big of an airdrop so the idea is the less you have the more you get. I don't think I've seen a blockchain before implement it on staking, I think the first time that I've seen this being implemented was only when I was preparing for the podcasts I saw on one of your Twitter accounts a print screen or a pole about what do you guys think and then I started to research and it was quite interesting, I've never seen this implement in before. Another cool thing I've seen across Idena was DeFi demo. I have noticedsome posts and some explanations on how it can play a big role and make an advertisement decentralized. Do you guys want to talk a little bit about that as well?</p>
<p>[00:33:49] TravCrypto: This is actually if you're referring to the concept of decentralized on-chain ads, this is something I actually was most excited about for Idena a while back. I think the concept of advertising on-chain in a decentralized way is really applying blockchain technology
in a way that can can really revolutionize an entire space like the centralized marketing. So how it works is essentially there's this concept of oracles on-chain and you can create an oracle, like an add and when you create this add it goes to the oracles or people to decide whether they're going to approve it. So it needs to be approved by the community first and once it is approved, then it is actually displayed on-chain so after the implementation it will be once year doing the validation ceremony you’ll actually see these adds displayed and the money spent on these adds is burned in the form of Idena’s native crypto currency. That's actually burned on-chain
in order to display these adds to people around the world. So i think that concept of decentralized marketing is really really cool and I think it adds a lot of value to the blockchain because obviously there's a lower supply and we all know the concepts of supply and demand over time.</p>
<p>[00:28:39] LTraveler: One more thing that I would like to add is that you can advertise whatever you want. We don't have rules. The only rule that we have is that the community must approve your ad. So you're sending an advertisement to be examined by comity of people that's going to be randomly selected from the whole network and then if you are getting the approval of majority you can run your advertisement company and this is very important because nobody can tell you nothing.So people will take a decision what is good and what is bad. This is the main point of the future because we always know about discrimination, about censorship, and all of that thing but for example why someone is going to choose what is good and what is bad because you have to ask like at least randomly of some members and if it is good why not? And this is the main principle of our advertisement platform and also you can run whatever oracle you want. For example you can ask whatever thing, you can make a poll. Then you can get a feedback from the community. Of course you have to pay for that but the feedback that you're getting from the real people it is very hard to manipulate that vote system and that's how we are implementing our Idena improvement proposals. First, the person who wants to propose that idea has to describe that idea pretty clear and then we have delegates and that delegates we are choosing every three epochs and then if the delegates approve the program then the program goes to the oracle vote part where everyone from the community is supposed to vote. Everyone can propose something even now we have a community wallet community foundation so if you're a developer you want to develop something new you have to prepare the paper, you have to get the majority from the majority of votes from five delegates that we are selecting every three epochs and then you're going to get that  majority then that paper going to be put it into the oracle voting and then if people say yes then you're going to get the foundation for your project or for your implementation. Recently we implemented community foundation to translate Idena chronicles into three languages and it was implemented in that new mechanism.</p>
<p>[00:39:18] Citizen Cosmos: what has been the most controversial decision that the community made? </p>
<p>[00:39:31] TravCrypto: I'll touch on two things real quick. One, oracles can be as controversial as you want them to be. In terms of oracles you could ask any question that you possibly want e whether it's politically whether it's opinion. One oracle off the top of my and this doesn't affect the blockchain in any way or the community is should abortion be a legal or illegal? Here you have this democratic system with community members literally all over the world in all different political environments from all backgrounds and they can just vote legal or illegal and there you get a true perspective into what people's true thoughts are on any given matter. So I thought that was really cool, I think that like a concept of true democracy but then another example are these improvement proposals like IIP-5 that was controversial within the community because there are certain people that think these mechanisms should be a certain way and then there's certain people that think they should be a different way but it's the coolest part about this is you always have differing opinions. That’s the basis of human nature to see when these proposals are brought up. It's not always just bi-partisan, it could be three or four different thought paths and everyone breaks down their own explanation of why they think it should be this way or the other way. Once you get those explanations then the community can put in their thoughts and when it's all said and done and you have this very broad overview of this IIP-5, that's when community members can take action and actually participate in voting and depending on the results of the vote that will create a hard fork of the blockchain which you could arguable say doesn't happen in most other blockchain communities. </p>
<p>[00:42:14] LTraveler: I want to add one more thing that because everything is private. You can ask whatever questions you want, nobody going to judge you. </p>
<p>[00:42:29] Citizen Cosmos: I have a wrap up traditional question for you. What keeps you motivated to do what you guys : are doing today? Whether it's for Idena or whether it's for the whole of blockchain industry.</p>
<p>[00:43:07] LTraveler: I would like to start because it reminds me the story of how that community proposals came out  about the translation. I was so attracted by the idea and I just wrote to the developers and said I want to translate your chronicle and they even agreed to pay me. Then, I started creating videos and the result was also good. What I feel is that apart from your job where you're just earning money there should be something that you're really happy to do. You do something that people really can use because they really need that. The key point of changing our society is to transform it from what we must do to something what we choose to do. For me me this is the key point and Idena really represented the ideas of fair democracies, it is the representation of that kind of style of society. We are small but at least you can feel that and this is wonderful. </p>
<p>[00:45:11] TravCrypto: For me it’s very similar to LTraveler. In the time that I've been in web3 professionally over the past three years and as a community member over the past six years I've seen a lot of different blockchains, a lot of different projects all promising different things. The thing that makes me most passionate about Idena is this concept of a truly decentralized democracy and what I mean by that is a global democracy where every humans can participate in this system and their vote can be heard which is really spectacular to me. I think it's a novel concept that hasn't been done at scale and I think Idena is the technology that can allow truly decentralized democracy to happen at scale.</p>
<p>[00:46:12] Citizen Cosmos: Guys, this has been a huge pleasure! Thank you very much for your time! </p>
