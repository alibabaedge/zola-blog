<p>[00:00:19] Citizen Cosmos: Hi everyone! Welcome to a new episode of Citizen Cosmos podcast! We have today two guests with us from Kadena, and it's Will Martino, the founder and president of Kadena and Randy Daal, the head of developer experience at Kadena. They will hopefully tell us all about Kadena, all about themselves, and everything else we want to know. Welcome to the show! </p>
<p>[00:00:39] Will Martino: Thanks so much for having us, Serge.</p>
<p>[00:00:42] Citizen Cosmos: So, there are two of you so we'll do a turn by turn. I usually present the guests,  but I think it's much cooler when the guests present themselves and say whatever they want people to know about them. So please, Will, I'll let you go first. Present yourself, tell us all what
you do. </p>
<p>[00:00:57] Will Martino: I'm the president and co-founder of Kadena. I met my co-founder Stuart Popejoy at JP Morgan. He had opened up a research desk working at high school there, It was in
Brooklyn and I was living in Brooklyn at the time, and one of my friends from college was working there so I got a gig working there because it was a couple stops away from my apartment. We ended up starting to work on crypto because it was back before Etherium
had launched and everyone under the sun was coming through JP Morgan trying to sell them on enterprise blockchain, and we needed to do diligence on behalf of the bank in this research group on blockchain. We ended up building JP Morgan coin version zero and open source to publish hyper ledger. The process like that informs a lot of how and why we built Kadena because we were doing this work on behalf of the bank and we knew that we would need certain answers to certain questions that we wouldn't be able to get industrial adoption without. That turned into us leaving and starting Kadena. Back before that I was at an Securities and Exchange Commission back before they had a crypto group because I was there when bellary formed it. I was the tech, I was back doing high frequency data analytics, building their super computing close to things, and then got tired of the government, went to hacker school for three months and to go learn Haskell and after that went to JP Morgan, and the rest of the history been doing Kadena for I think six and a half years now. </p>
<p>[00:02:24] Citizen Cosmos: That is the story! I would drop the mic at this point but to be honest I know your story of course, I just wanted you to share it. I have a lot a lot of questions about your story to you, we will get back to them for sure. Please, Randy, introduce yourself. </p>
<p>[00:02:38] Randy Daal: I'm leader of developer experience at Kadena, I started in April so I don’t have a long history that Will has. I started out as a job for developer at the airline company. I’m based in Netherlands. After that I soon made the transition after four years to front-end  because that was really my passion and I always have a saying that  you want to work on something where you find passion. I started switching my career towards front-end development work there
for my in the fifteen years created all kinds of front-end application for large companies in the Netherlands. At one point in my career I founded my own company where I started out my own front-end company and basically from there on I started doing a lot with the community. I started a foundation called Frontmania where we created all kinds of fun stuff with friend community, educating people with conferences and meetups. I think somewhere in November I got into contact with Will and he told me all about Kadena, it wasn’t the first time I heard the name but I didn't know that it was that awesome. We got into a conversation and I could really help Kadena to grow on the front-end side. Will got me really enthusiastic basically and that's why I started in April working on the developer experience and until now it's a nice experience for me to talk to the community, see what they need. We got so many ideas and I will tell you about that later but it's going to be a real fun road for me and the community.</p>
<p>[00:04:23] Citizen Cosmos: Before I'm going to move back to Will, I have a question for you. Were you not terrified of starting working for Kadena? It’s a big project. Was it not terrifying to start at something that big? </p>
<p>[00:04:53] Randy Daal: I'm not really terrified of challenges. Challenges are something I like. It was something I would like to do. Also my background is I'm a big sports fan. I play sports on high level, so challenges is a way of life for me and that's what I like here as well. Starting your own company it's big challenge as well, the only difference which you have now is there's everything is exposed, everything is open source but everything you do should be spot on and I'm a perfectionist. It is fun for me working with a lot of smart people and Kadena is filled with amazing talents and a lot of smart people to learn a lot from. So no not really scared, more enthusiastic
to work with such bright minds.</p>
<p>[00:05:41] Citizen Cosmos: Will, let's get back to you. I follow Kadena for a while and for everybody who's listening out there I'm also a token holder, so I'm going to put my cards on the table straight away just in case people do ask. But let's talk about JP Morgan first. I remember when JP Morgan coin came around, it was 2016 or 2017. How did you end up working for them and how did you suddenly realize that you wanted to go into something your own?</p>
<p>[00:06:13] Will Martino: That's a long story. There's this tradition inside of banks in New York and I believe London and Paris, where sometimes you'll get new CTOs, new management at the very high levels of these investment banks and they'll put together kind of like a pet RnD group to do some critical RnD they we’ve been wanting to do for long period of time. That group got forked and the way that you normally formed these is you go and you grab some very experienced higher level manager and then some extremely experienced engineers to run the various desks that you're going to fork. So I think this one had three desks. So, Stuart Popejoy, my co-founder was rewrote their agency equity trading platform which actually is a really important part of a Kadena story.  So the business case for this thing was that in the agency desk they had these
institutional clients and they would call up their clients and say “Hey, how do you want to trade?” and the clients would describe to them basically an algorithm of how they would want to execute their portfolios and balance things. They used to call them up and then they spend and then the traders would spend two months with the engineers getting these things implemented, getting them rolled in a production. So Stuart rewrote the trading  engine and a bunch of other stuff but the main thing that's relevant for the Kadena story is that he wrote a domain specific language that traders could actually code on the phone. Basically it is like taking notes except that you
could execute these notes while they're talking with their clients. This took the turn around time from call to production from two months to about two days. It would be like one day to get it into queue and the one day to get it actually shipped. So these are technical non-programmers who are now writing this domain specific language for algorithmic trade and the experience of that how to write a safe like domain specific language for technical non-programmers informs a lot of how we design PACT or smart contract language because we see them as very similar things. Blockchains are the databases with store procedures decentralized with coins. It has the notion of money built into it but at their core they're these databases and smart contracts with the store          procedures on top and you can do tons of stuff with that so when we started working on Kadena, Stuart headed the RnD for PACT and all of that experience of years writing a language for technical programmers informed how we wrote PACT. That's why we kept PACT simple and that ended up having a lot of benefits later on being able to do formal verification and that is as easy to code in as the actual language itself being able to show contracts to lawyers who are domain experts but aren't programmers. So he finished that up and then he didn't retire out of JP morgan but took some time off and they came back to him six months later and asked if he wanted to run this RnD desk down the street from your apartment and how does he feel. He agreed and his first hire was one of my good friends out of Yele University. He was a big haskell guy, Stuart wanted to do the desk in haskell just kind of to try to see how this would go. We all like the language and so Carter pulled me in. I went and interviewed and everyone was expecting me. Then I joined up and within about a year we started enterprise blockchain. Our desk ended up capturing that as like the thing that we could focus on first before any of the other desks was that in doing some of the background research. Back in the school I had written the scheme implementation, like a little domain specific language that looks like PACT and when we were doing some research at JP we found this hardened BFT raft variant from Stanford research project that was written in haskell. So over the course of a weekend I had  a fully functioning private blockchain that was executing around five hundred transactions a second and was able to run EVM and scheme side by side. That was how we just we kic dropped that. </p>
<p>[00:10:45] Citizen Cosmos: That's impressive! I have my first controversial question. You come from the world of enterprise blockchain and not just enterprise blockchain, you come from the enterprise world. Let's talk stigmas here a little bit, most people who use blockchain they automatically tie up blockchain technology and decentralization philosophy together and when people from the
enterprise world come they say that enterprise blockchain will destroy them. What would you
say to those things? Are those just crazy talks or does that have anything to it? </p>
<p>[00:11:23] Will Martino: It’s a good question. I think that enterprise adoption of blockchain technology will matter in the long term. I don't think you can have full adoption of crypto currency and blockchain technology without that happening but as we’ve seen, it's going to take a long time.
This isn't like the internet which has started quickly taking over a bunch of different domains, this is much more like advent and money which maybe  even like up to a generation that actually convert over. Those aren't the chains that I'm worried about. I'm more worried about the VC chains and the the more exchange focus chains because enterprise really doesn't understand blockchain and I would be surprised if we see any major industrial adoption enterprises before 2030. Since we started Kadena that was our target. We asked ourselves, what do we need to build so that by 2030 when enterprise catches up, we're ready to go and that's why we built Kadena the way we did. It's the VC chains that I worry about more because you just end up with these, you end with the proof of stake networks or you have a few whales who are these major VC funds that do not have a good track record in doing things for the common good and they have this massively outside voting control but it's also basically hidden because it's anonymous enough and everyone knows about these chains and knows who controls it but you can't really
track it. It's one of things that I've always loved about Cosmos from the beginning, was they burnt one of these chains, they did a very decentralized launch, they have a great community and they stuck to their guns on that since the beginning and didn't try to take the short cut as some other chains have. So those are the ones that I worry about the most because those ones do not have their community's interests at heart and  they're really just kind of waiting to mature and get people stuck. They're waiting for people to not be able to migrate off because so many things get integrated and then I suspect that you're going to see a mate voting changes that are of course decentralized and they're going to change things like the gas model to do some rent extraction. I’m not going to name names that's not our style but it's like general themes like those are the ones that i worry about the most. IBM poisoned that well so hard from 2018 to 2019. We were still focused on enterprise back then, we were doing enterprise alongside public and IBM’s ability to force all of their clients to try to do an enterprise change when their technology wasn't even a blockchain and couldn't even run. We sent people to some of their workshops and in the workshops the IBM guy couldn't even get people's computers to run their blockchain. The well is so poisoned that it's going to take at least five more years. You need
almost like a cycling of the upper management in companies before you're going to be able to really do enterprise blockchain again. </p>
<p>[00:14:31] Citizen Cosmos: Yeah it makes sense. There are a lot of VCs out there, some of them could
own up to like certain percent and I'm not talking about just a network, I’m talking about the whole market cup. I think they do some good things especially with RnD, they do have a lot of Rnd that they  bring forward and hopefully that RnD can be used to get better and to improve what we are doing in general. Last question about your your history. You worked at SEC and you worked for the committee. What was it?</p>
<p>[00:15:16] Will Martino: It was the crypto currency working group back then, now it's the digital ledger technology group. It was back when it was Valery who formed the group. She still runs that now. 
It was me and one person that were basically brought on by her to be the first people  in it and then we grew it from there. It all started because they just had some cases. They needed to look at someone who was in the ASSC who didn't own any coin and who understood the tech. Bitcoin was at sixty and I decided between buying Bitcoin at sixty and going into this. Based on how Kadena started and my career since then, I maintained that was the right decision but it's been close for years. It was fun, I can't talk too much about it because I am still a domain expert at the intersection of regulation and technology in the space so there's just not a ton of details I can go into. We should all be happy that the ASSC didn't go the path that New York did with the bitcoin license because that would have messed up a lot more stuff. At least they've been slow and diligent about it as opposed to coming in and just crashing on the grade. </p>
<p>[00:16:26] Citizen Cosmos: Did that experience give you more understanding of how  to go with Kadena?</p>
<p>[00:16:36] Will Martino: I think it's intuition because this stuff isn't set down in case law. The way that Kadena structure will be by twenty thirty be kind of set in stone or at least the guidance that we provided. But until that guidance comes out you can't be sure so that we all have to be super careful. Now we've been essentialized for years, we've been in production for years, we're in a very good place now, it's always the launching period that's hard but based in the way that we did it we're pretty confident that if we're not good then most of the entire industry has major
problems. We'll see where it goes. I'm hopeful that we get some clear guidance. I'm very thankful that they didn't come and really screw things up. </p>
<p>[00:17:20] Citizen Cosmos: First question about Kadena. It's going to sound silly to both of you but i
like to break things down. So a multichain network, let's talk about this. You have proof of work, proof of stake, multichain network. What on earth does it mean for the regular user out there who is just browsing the Cosmos ecosystem or Coingecko looking for gems or for anything else but from gems you know he's looking for l1s. Can you guys whoever wants to answer this explain how it works and what does it mean?</p>
<p>[00:17:51] Will Martino: It is technical to describe. It's difficult for me to even coverwith people who aren't  you know like serious consensus researchers just in like a two minute thing. In Cosmos you have the Cosmos Hub, then you have folks off of it those folks may have their own coins you can lock up coins and put them on the other chains through IBC but at the end of the day they aren't one network. It's a series of networks that can interoperate and talk to each other. So that's like the hub model. People are also familiar with dags, they directed a cycle graph which basically means that you have a ledger that you can run transactions and parallel in that is another approach to scaling, Solon's famous for this one. What we do that is different as
we have like real horizontal scaling so we have one coin that you can transfer from one chain to another chain. All of these chains are peers with each other and they are all in the same network and it's proof of work that actually allows us to do this so if you've heard of webt2 scaling with companies like Google where they do horizontal scaling, where you can just throw more servers at something to scale it up, we do something very similar but with us it's more chains now you can't just throw more chains at our network. We launched with ten chains we hard for up to twenty chains. Theoretically, you can hard work up to a billion chains. I don't think we ever going get there. I think a hundred thousand chains which would represent fifteen million transactions a second or something like that is the highest that we would ever see and I suspect
that would take two decades to get to because ours is much more demand driven as our network grows and we need more scale than we hard work to bigger and bigger networks and of course things all decentralized, we do a lot of the core RnD but we take APRs from outside the community and if we misbehave as a foundation then we fully expect people to do what they've done with the proof of work network. So the way that works is that you you have each of these chains running, just a single chain like Ethereum or Bitcoin but they're all in the same network so you can run transactions on gen 1 or gen 19, and you can also do cross-chain messaging through simple payment verification and that's pretty much it. The secret sauce is proof of work is this weird thing where you can actually split up the work that's being done in
every chain and make the overall system more efficient because right now we have twenty chains. When we go up to say forty chains, what we do is we drop the difficulty of each chains the new block in half keep the overall rate throughput. From an energy used point of view we increase our overall energy used by maybe one percent and in return get double the proof. It’s because proof of work is weird and because the amount of mining that goes into a network isn't related to the overall transaction throughput and you can just  split it up and things actually
getting more secure as your scale which is this weird kind of shunk probability theory that proof of work captures but it works and it's really simple. So, proof of work works, it's just not efficient and we set out to solve that and then of course we threw on PACT or smart contract language and that just allows you to now have this a multithreaded list machine in the sky that you can really do whatever you want with.</p>
<p>[00:21:04] Citizen Cosmos: Randy, quick question to you from a perspective of developer experience. Working with both proof of work and proof of stake, how does it work for you?</p>
<p>[00:21:26] Randy Daal: So, all our chains are based on proof of work. We can maybe in the future go through a
hybrid state but that's not necessary because our chain solves all the problems with proof of work. The only thing we need to improve at Kadena, I mean our primary focus for the last few years has been the greatest state of the first layer blockchain development solution and in my opinion, Kadena completely revolutionized the blockchain world in that part but one thing it doesn't matter how good your technology might be, nothing can replace a good user experience that really is essential. So that's why Will basically came up to me and asked me to help them out on that part and currently we're busy creating a whole new developer experience that would be truly game changing. At the moment building an application or a platform can be tough, you have a pretty high learning curve as well as the documentation written in a more traditional manner. So that's why we're focusing on creating new documentation side, we're also engaging a lot more with the community of what they need from us. We're going to build it developer academy where people can have certifications and badges so when a developer comes into Kadena and gets certified so people will know who get trained in how to do things properly and with that we also kind of developed user friendly tooling, creating robust APIs and SDKS. So it really doesn't matter if you use proof of work, it's the layer on top of that brings developer experience. That should be transparent for developers and users. </p>
<p>[00:23:20] Citizen Cosmos: What's your number one thing to go out and attract developers? Today the competition in l1s is enormous and obviously without developers it's a bit hard to build an open source chain.</p>
<p>[00:23:39] Randy Daal: So the main thing where we need to focus on it should be easy to develop something on Kadena. So if you look at our APIs at the moment, they're very low level, so if you want to to mint an NFT, you have to do a lot of stuf. The thing is, we should focus on instead of explaining developers of how to built something. The main thing I always go back to is when a couple of years ago you had that battle between Internet Explorer and FireFox, and they were battling each other who has is the best browser, and then very lately Chrome came into play and if you look nowadays, they are the main browsers people are using and it's not because they were better browsers, they focused on technology, they focused on the good developer experience because it was really easy to build applications by using Chrome and that's what we need to focus on as well. It should be easy for developers to build something on Kadena and that's where you’ll get a better and greater adoption,and for that we also need the community to help us out on what they're missing, and that's why you need to interact with community as well.</p>
<p>[00:24:57] Citizen Cosmos: Will, do you want to add something? </p>
<p>[00:24:59] Will Martino: I do actually, I want to amplify some parts. Some other parts that we have are a very large grant program that we do for going to helping people to be able to kick start helping be able to kick start actually going out and building. It was very easy to apply for and I think we're gonna have our first major announcement some time in July. On top of that there's some other parts that I think are more at the infrastructure level because Randy has more actual development experience and part of the experience is not attracting developers but being able to keep them. If you want to go and have your own NFT platform, you need to roll out your own network and then run it, and that's a bigger lift to do. In Cosmos they built their core community and by moving on to their own spot makes sense but for DID launch itself on Cosmos as the first step I feel I would have a lot of adoption problems so it's one of the reasons that we wanted to scale layer one itself so that you don't have to run your own infrastructure, just deploy your application just like you could with Etherium which then gets to the second problem that we avoid by being able to scale and actually having a scalable platform is low gas fees. That said, it's really the core focus of what gas is for, it limits the amount of computation so you don't solve a network and really that it means we don't want people to do it outside of that, we want the
piece to be as low as possible for everyone. So if all of a sudden you know you don't run into the Etherium problem where launching a new project is now super expensive, so this is one of the other reasons that we get scaling is so important as it applies to developer experience because you just don't have to worry about that with Kadena because the gas fees are just so much lower. So the part that Randy focuses on is how do you integrate, how do you build, how you get the front-end working there. These other parts that we found have been very attractive to developers because we have this story of launching crypto kitties on our platform and let’s say our platform is going to have massive massive adoption and you've just deployed it to chain zero. You can now deploy to change one through ten in addition to that, and now you have ten times the through put for your application and it takes a little bit of tooling but you deploy it out, there's no one that can stop you and now you have ten times a through put and it costs basically the same if you will be able to scale up your app. Then, we get to the point where you're on every chain and you're saturating all the chains. That's what we talk about when we say adoption drives the scale of the layer one itself because as the time approaches we're going to notice it. The community is going to notice and all of us are going to start to get ready for hard work to changes so that network always grows to meet the capacity of the demand. This is one of my core theses for crypto in general. Now we have straight decentralized work and we don't have the problem that all the other l1s have. </p>
<p>[00:29:07] Citizen Cosmos: This is a really great answer because a lot of founders unfortunately don't pay attention to attracting developers from the beginning to the scelability of the net and what we get
is somebody building a cool application which breaks the network and then you have problems. I’m going to ask a question that's going to sound really stupid to you both of you but I need to ask it because Kadena is always listed as a Cosmos ecosystem project everywhere. What's the reason for this?</p>
<p>[00:29:45] Will Martino: I think it's because we've known them forever. I think they first presented Tenderment when we were presenting our private blockchain. We were presenting PACT formal verification of our smart contract language, it was still in development in that time. That was a really funny conference because you had a bunch of the people who now have a bunch of top projects. So I think it's because we've known them for so long we don't see ourselves as being competitive to Cosmos. It serves different needs, we don't have vast finality, because proof of work, our finality, is still in the order of like thirty seconds to a minute. There are certain apps that really do need that and there're certain apps that you want to run of your system on a proof of work network and then you want to run other networks that are more running on a proof of stake because you if want to do settlement on a proof of work network because you want that decentralization but you want the fast finality of a proof of stake system. So we've always seen it as complimentary and because of that we've just been working with Cosmos for a long time, before we working on IBC for a while, we were working with Terra before. The next place that will be looking at with Cosmos is definitely IBC but I’ve been recently getting a lot into zero now proofs and certain knowledge bridges from the point of view bridging and I suspect that will probably be the first time that we have true bridging between our two networks is getting an IBC system that has some knowledge component so that we can solve who owns the key for the bridges problem. </p>
<p>[00:31:29] Citizen Cosmos: Because right now I think if I go into the ecosystem part of the Kadena website and if I go click on the bridges section, IBC does come up but it doesn't have a link to it so I guess it's all kind of planted.</p>
<p>[00:31:44] Will Martino: Yeah, something has been worked on for a fair bit of time but definitely Terra’s implosion got in the way of us focusing on rolling it out this summer so we're still figuring out the business case for it, figuring out what we're going to do with it because bridges are important for Kadena. We had some bridges that were sort of ready to go this time last year that i didn't pull the plug on. But I basically stalled them because I was looking at them and they were so unsafe, they're going to get hacked. This approach in general is just not okay and over the preceding year I feel very vindicated in that decision because we've seen so many bridge hacks that I don't really feel bad about it. Wormhole for example, they hadn't gotten saved by FTX  I don't know what would have happened to that ecosystem but they managed to dodge. </p>
<p>[00:32:49] Citizen Cosmos: And to be honest, Wormhole was using bloc chain back in 2015. I'm not saying that's a bad thing necessarily but in 2015 using Wormhole wasn't a great user experience at all. So we talked about easiness of onboarding developers. You have PACT which is the smart count language you guys developed and I think in 2017 or 2018 I read and was quite impressed with the things I saw. There was a lot of concepts there about atomic execution, there were a lot of things which are not new to anything but against the language feels more like a blockchain developer friendly. Randy would you correct me here about that? Does Pact really make onboard developers easier or is it a stone you have to overcome? </p>
<p>[00:33:44] Randy Daal: I think nowadays for every smart contract you always have to learn a new language and Pact is a very easy language to learn. It's a list based language so that the only thing people have to overcome is all the parenthesis but it’s a very easy language to learn and that's what you see in the community as well once it clicks, it clicks and that's what feedback we're getting. A lot of people working but the only thing is if you're working with a cripting language you really are focused on a certain way of developing. It can be a bit harder to get acquainted with Pact, but it’s very intuitive and that's what I think Stuart wanted to accomplish as well, to create a language that is very easy to learn and very quick to create smart contract with. In my opinion he succeeded in that.</p>
<p>[00:34:40] Will Martino: The thing with Pact is that we could have gotten a different route and had something that looked and felt like Javascript which is the path that some other projects have taken which makes it easier to onboard the developers. First because you have a bunch of people who aren't very good at Javascript and you can go and grab them and then make be
not very good at your smart contract language. But here's the problem. On the Internet you can evolve your website you can evolve it so it can be better. For smart contracts, when you deploy them, they are themselves a bug bounty and we intentionally decided not to go that route because safety matters more than everything else when it comes to smart contracts. So instead we have a safe language that is intuitive but is a little bit different in the beginning to get your head around. It's closer to the way I described, it is much closer to learning sequel for a data based for queries than it is to learning a Javascript because you can get up and run it quickly but as time goes on, you need to learn more and it's hard to do it safely. It is hard to do it at scale, in a way that you don't end up shooting your own foot off. Whereas in sequel you need to wrap your head around the idea of a table and this relational algebra that the language is expressing. After that everything clicks and it's very easy. Writing Uber in Pact would be very difficult if not impossible but then again, Uber would never run on top of a blockchain.  It was that mantra that really draw us to do Pact the way that it is and then students’ experience with writing this language for non-programmers who were technical informed a lot of how we design
things so that it would be very easy to learn. So yes there's a little bit of initial onboarding that's more difficult because but then it's usually about two or three days and I usually just help people look at the coin contracts, download it and get it running. </p>
<p>[00:37:18] Randy Daal: I also want to add something. I think the adoption of Pact will also help when we bring out the academy. I think that will help a lot. It’ll help onborning of new developers way more than what it is nowadays because now if people want to learn Pact, they really have to dive in and there's a lot of content on the Internet to find but it's not centralized and if we centralize all the content, give them a learning part we'll be adopted way more.</p>
<p>[00:37:41] Citizen Cosmos: i don't know if you guys heard about Urbit and Hoon. They have their own language which a runic language. I’m just talking about like easiness of onboarding developers because that language is completely made up from scratch and it's got different concept to most things and I don't think that especially you developed language that is concentrated on security. It’s the opposite, it should be easier to adopt and that's that's a great thing. One more thing that I did notice. Considering we think of ourselves as ecosystem developers we go out and help networks. It's hard not to notice how much attention Kadena is paying to ecosystem development. You have the accelerator programs, you have the academy you mentioned, you have a big ecosystem, the community is growing all the time, you have a lot of channels. Is that intentional, the focus ecosystem development on the community or that happened because you have the experience and you understand what you're doing and you understand that that's important or was that a natural evolvemental thing? </p>
<p>[00:39:08] Will Martino: It's a generic yes. I think the first trunk of Kadena's time was designing how we
scale and figuring out  what the protocol is like and then I was building a protocol, and then we launched Rnd and it became much more focused on adoption. We know it's stable, we demonstrate that. At the same time we have this community that was clamoring for support and hiring a bunch of people. But Kadena itself is a longer play and it's a longer project. Our entire tokeneconomic system is designed around a hundred and twenty year mission which is just weird for crypto. No one plans at that span of time. We figured out so much and also that means that crypto is now fully adopted in the global standard, so we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, it will be fine. We don't move super fast because it’s not web2, it’s web3, you can't move fast and break things because when you do you get hacked and that’s a huge problem. We have a different approach and it's a slower one where we just keep building and building. I think we hit that stage where it made sense for us to build the foundation for the ecosystems, build the academy. Also, we found Randy. I have been literally looking for someone who fits Randy's position for three years.</p>
<p>[00:41:33]
Citizen Cosmos: I've been professionally working blocking for seven years now and the amount of chains I've seen come and go because of the lack of attention to system and developer experience. People just close their eyes to it as if it doesn't exist and it's great that you
pay attention to it! I'm going to take into the last block of questions. Will, what was the goal and the motivation in deciding to build an l1 blockchain? I mean nobody just wakes up and thinks “I'm going to go and build the most scalable product!” There must have been something that led you here internally to this point. What was it?</p>
<p>[00:42:27] Will Martino: I mean part of it is the context and the timing at JP Morgan, just like having that experience having that in our background, having Stuart as a co-founder without whom I’d never would have done it. That was definitely part of it and part of it was that doing that due diligence at JP Morgan, we ended up with this one page of core questions we now needed to get answered if there was ever going to be industrial adoption blockchain and we knew that no one like we knew. We looked at every single project that was either coming up or that was being launched or had already launched and we knew that nothing answered even a quarter of these things very basic things. We had this core belief that crypto is going to be a thing and that it's going to have widespread global adoption within our lifetimes and we desisded someone needs to do it. So I left and did it. I don’t think without JP Morgan we would have had the motivation because we wouldn't have seen both the potentia, the shortcomings that we saw because
there were so few projects that were coming out of anyone who had major financial experts even if most of the projects don't even have founders who have major industrial experts usually they're coming out of either other startups or the coming out of open source or coming out of research and cryptography. We came at it from a very different angle. We had an industrial background and leverage that because we knew what's going to be needed if this thing is ever going to be industrial adoption and no one else is going to do this and no one has those backgrounds.</p>
<p>[00:44:12] Citizen Cosmos: Randy i didn't ask you for your blockchain story but what motivated you? What led you to decide to go into blockchain in the first place? </p>
<p>[00:44:25] Randy Daal: I was always interested in crypto, I think since 2017. But I think the talk I had
with Will in November really got me enthusiastic and really drove into my blockchain technology and that's what basically got me into Kadena.</p>
<p>[00:44:45] Citizen Cosmos: What did he tell you? </p>
<p>[00:44:51] Randy Daal: Basically, the people work in blockchain, especially at Kadena are extremely smart and I like to work with the best of the best because if you work with great people you will get a great product and that's what they have done at Kadena and that's currently what I'm doing at the  moment as well for the developer experience. I'm trying to create a dream team and so we're basiclly building the best team out there and we focus on building, for us not good enough is not great on the strife of perfection. </p>
<p>[00:45:31] Citizen Cosmos: My last question to both of you. What motivates both of you to get out of bed every day and to keep on doing whatever it is you're doing? What would you like to advise to others?</p>
<p>[00:46:13] Randy Daal: For me it's like being an entrepreneur within the company itself so Kadena motivates me by telling me “do what you think is best.” I can create my own team do, what I think is best
for the community, creating a whole new developer experience and even if it means throwing away old stuff in creating new stuff that gives me the motivation to build awesome things and that's why I want to get out of the bed every morning and start working. </p>
<p>[00:46:54] Citizen Cosmos: Will?</p>
<p>[00:46:55] Will Martino: I think it starts with the team and I've been doing this forever so it definitely starts with the team. We have is amazing the people we get to work with are brilliant. I don't know what else to say. We are strategically tied together, we’re going in : the right direction and we all find that it's meaningful. We all believe that crypto is going to be a thing and that solving the efficiency problems and the scaling problems do matter in the long term. At the same time we get to work on this really cool thing that we've built. It's just a really well built organization.</p>
<p>[00:48:14] Citizen Cosmos: Guys it's been a huge huge pleasure! Thank you for finding the time, I know it wasn't easy.  Looking forwards to IBC working with Kadena! Join the Kadena social networks!</p>

<h2 id="transcript-of-the-episode">Transcript of the Episode:</h2>
<p>[00:01:40] Citizen Cosmos: Hi, everybody! Welcome to a new episode of Citizen Cosmos, today I have Spaydh with me from Neutron. I don't know if you guys heard about it or not, but if you haven't, it means you're going to hear all about it today, and if you have - even better because you're going to find out more stuff about it. Spaydh, man, hi, and welcome to the show!</p>
<p>[00:02:00] Spaydh: Hey! Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here. </p>
<p>[00:02:03] Citizen Cosmos: I am thrilled actually because Neutron is on the tip of the tongue of a lot of people, so I would like to talk about that, of course, but also I would like to talk a little bit more about you and about what you do, and what you're planning. So the first thing is first to introduce yourself in your own words. What do you do, and what is Neutron?</p>
<p>[00:02:26] Spaydh: Sure. So I am deputy general manager at Neutron, which means I get to do everything that is not development related. The way our team works is that we have 11 devs right now, plus me, so I do everything else. In a few words, Neutron is a small contract platform that is interchain secured by the Cosmos Hub, which means it shares its benefits from the security of the Cosmos Hub in exchange for which it provides revenue to the Cosmos Hub. That small contract platform has a few features which allow you to easily create cross-chain protocols that act as if they were just one protocol. In a unit matter, essentially through interesting accounts, through interesting queries which allow you to control accounts on other blockchains, execute transactions, track execution stages, and also receive data about that blockchain in a trust-minimized manner over IBC. </p>
<p>[00:03:20] Citizen Cosmos: That's cool, man! You guys have incorporated all the rewards to do with interest, and we’ll talk about all those things in a little bit. I know you guys are incubated by P2P, and I have a lot of connections to that, Constantine particularly, of course, was a guest on our podcast, and we've worked together for years and years before. So what's your story, man? How did you get Neutron? How did you get into blockchain? </p>
<p>[00:04:10] Spaydh: I guess what got me into crypto was that since 2013  with Snowden’s revelations about various government programs that were doing a large-scale collection of data across the world, not just in the US but in various countries with my conviction that computers and code would take a more and more important place in our lives, I’ve been very interested in computing systems but also privacy as a question of how do you know what balance do you need. I was interested in all of this, and during my long nights on the internet, I found out about Bitcoin. It was 2016 or 2017. I was pretty young at the time. Then I ended up finding out about Etherium, and then I realized I can make a wall computer and put tons of stuff on it. I was sold on the idea, but I had just 30$ in my pocket per month, so I didn’t become a millionaire in the next bull market. But that’s what’s got me hooked. I like the idea of Bitcoin removing the intermediaries between financial transactions. I'm not a big fan of the banks like a lot of people here in this system, so to me, the idea that you could make a shared computer that was fully decentralized across the world was also really cool. All of these things got me into crypto, but then I was still doing my studies, I was traveling, I was working as a journalist across the world, and I was following from a distance what was going on until DeFi summer and twenty 2021, mostly when I started hearing about it a bit more, so that piqued my interest. I came back and found my old wallet in which there was 200$ of Ethereum, and I had a reason to go back hard on this, and then suddenly, Ethereum had completely changed. There were dozens of apps on top of Ethereum that you could use to do various DeFi stuff, and so suddenly, you could have a full-time job just researching what was going on. So that's basically what I did. At the time, I was living in Thailand already but working as a teacher, so I would teach English during the day and then research crypto basically as a full-time job at night, so I became a very involved community member in Ethereum and also in Terra at the time and ripped my portfolio. But the whole thing about that is that because Terra was much smaller in terms of how many people were interacting, there any people who have established it allowed me to very quickly meet a lot of the people who were actively engaged in the ecosystem. I started participating, helping produce the briefs of what was said, giving them to the community so that people who had missed the calls could still have that information, and participating on the forums. So the way I got professionally into crypto was that one day there was this proposal on the anchor for about updating SD Luna with a new version of the liquid staking derivative to SD Luna and at the end of this post, there was this small mention that of you think you have skills that we could use, just send us a message and let's chat. And so I thought perhaps there's something that could be done, so I did message them, and we chatted for a while, and that's how I started as a community manager later at Terra. The confusing thing here is that actually, my employer has been PGP from the start because the way it works is that Lido as a DAO is a pretty big organization that coordinates everything that happens across all of Lido. Still, in terms of development and active management, it's mostly focused on Ethereum Ecosystem, including l1s and l2s  as well and so to be able to expand to have that bandwidth with a limited amount of devs. What Lido does is often enter contractual relationships with other teams through governance, and so teams like this include P2P and Chorus 1 but also others who have done the deployment on Polkadot polygon, Salona, Terra, and so the way it works is that we'll give you some Lido tokens to create imitation and then if you can reach some degree of market cap you will get a bonus to motivate you to maintain and grow the protocol. P2P had this kind of agreement with Lido for later on Terra, and so that's why I joined PHP as a community team manager. So the rest is history, but basically, the team that was making Lido on Terra was also researching how to make proper liquid staking in Cosmos, and in the course of their research, they found a lot of ideas. Their thesis was that we would like to do it as a smart contract, and we need some technical prerequisites for this to be possible and so which platform allows us to do this? There are many platforms in Cosmos, but none of them allows you to meet these requirements right now and so we shared a lot within P2P, and so all of these criteria and these things that were blocking Lido spread through the org and the realization. If one protocol like Lido is blocked on this lack of security, lack of ability to interact with the blockchains via inquiries and retrieve data from other blockchains. It’s very likely there are other protocols that could deploy on Cosmos that can't because they don't have access to these premises that they would be interested in having to deploy in Cosmos. And so from there, we can't have started thinking if we could technically build a blockchain that does this for one protocol. We could build. This was just the light of the team, but how about we take this and we make it a product that everybody can deploy? so that's how the idea of a Neutron was born, and then we started working on it for months until prop 72 hit the forums, and it aligned with what we wanted for a Neutron. We wanted to be intersecured because we saw it as one way of having much higher security from the get-go but also as a way to have a very close alignment with the rest of the ecosystem. We’re aligned by default. That means if the Neutron goes rogue or becomes hurtful to the rest of the ecosystem, it's very easy for the hub to pull the plug at the same time. The Hub should not be incentivized to pull the plug off the Neutron because if the Neutron is successful it should be driving a ton of revenue to add to Atom takers and you have this very nice property here that is that we have to cooperate. It's all about corporation essentially, so that's my story and Neutron’s in a nutshell. </p>
<p>[00:10:48] Citizen Cosmos: That's pretty cool that the role of Neutron is cooperation because blockchains are a lot about reaching consensus. Whether it's a cooperation of
nodes, a cooperation of governance, or the cooperation of actors in whatever ecosystem is in question. Another question. You said that you were quite young when you got into the whole Bitcoin topic, and the question is: was that still school-age or after? The reason I’m asking is that I’ve been going through this topic with a lot of guests about how the adoption level of crypto turns around the world. I think one cool measurement for that is to see whether people got into it in school already or when they already had jobs.</p>
<p>[00:12:08] Spaydh: I remember buying my first Bitcoin on Coinbase in the queue to my high school cafeteria.</p>
<p>[00:12:16] Citizen Cosmos: That to me means that adoption is happening and happening, especially among the generation that, in my opinion, can do something with it. I'm sorry to everybody and including my generation here, but I think it’s more important that this happens like that and not only by your employer or something like that. Let's go back to the topic, but that was a very curious kind of thing to see how it evolved.</p>
<p>[00:12:41] Spaydh: I agree. The age of people when they discover crypto is an interesting metric. </p>
<p>[00:12:46] Citizen Cosmos: It’s for developers as well. The first time I saw this was in Cyber house. It was a place in Minsk, Belarussia, in 2015 or 2016 where Constantine and other
people used to meet. I remember there was a developer, a kid essentially. He was 14 and was already into smart contracts. And that’s when I thought: “Yeah, it’s working!”</p>
<p>[00:13:24] Spaydh: What do you think about 12 y/o kid from the USA, I think, who made millions selling NFTs? I think his name is Pixel Whales. </p>
<p>[00:13:46] Citizen Cosmos: Yeah, it was cool. I also recently saw on Twitter it was Josh Lee’s post about a 12 y/o kid called Badkidsart who draws Cosmos now, as far as I know. Back to cooperation. You're welcome to talk about Lido and Neutron in this case. What are your thoughts in general on the decentralization of stake? There is a lot of talk about Lido and a lot of talk about Ethereum. What are your thoughts in general? Because you guys have been somehow involved in all those stories. What can be done about that? </p>
<p>[00:15:40] Spaydh: That's a million-dollar question! First, before we talk about it, I want to clarify that the Neutron itself does not deal with stage validators. It’s interchain secured. The Cosmos Hub does that. Neutron doesn’t separate products, it’s a smart contract platform. Lido is a liquid staking protocol. There’s a smart contract that will most likely launch on top of Neutron. What I'm going to say now is my personal belief. I've been in touch with validators and Lido’s node operator group. My take on this is that the way the staking mechanisms work and most blockchains do tend to centralize take, and that's for multiple reasons. Some of
them are fairly trivial. But there are more profound centralizing forces when it comes to state distribution, and that's the fact that not all validators have access to the same communication channels, PR, but also not all of them have access to the same order flow, and I think that's 
the most significant point here is that if you're Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, you already have a user base and that user base is pretty huge. If they're going to be holding those tokens because they're speculating on them or they're taking a long position on them they're going to be holding these tokens in your platform, they might as well just yield on them, and so you can make this very easy for them and even make it more comfortable than delegating directly at the blockchain’s level because what you can do is you can have a one-click process, or you choose your token you stake amount that you want, and then if you want to withdraw you can do it instantly because instead of staking everything though their validator they can keep a small part of it as a soothing pool kind of so that you can withdraw at any time. So you don't even have to care about the bonding period unless everybody is leaving on drugs and so the house streamlined the process is how comfortable it is for you as a staker: you don't have to care about the morning period, you don't have to care about government, you don't have to care about anything really. You can just be speculating and earning a yield on stuff that gives a tremendous advantage to this kind of entity who is able to have a vertically integrated business model when it comes to staking. And so what we see is that centralizing changes have grown pretty fat on most of the blockchains they operate on, and that's even without liquid staking. So you stake and get the yield, but you don't actually even get a token that you can use in other platforms. Coinbase was the first one to recently enable this for Coinbase Eth, and the success of it now is pretty tremendous. It's the fastest-growing liquid-taking derivative in Ethereum, and so obviously some of it is probably just people who were already staking with Coinbase but now are also getting the derivative, but some of it is most likely new growth as well. So the idea is that you need decentralized alternatives to centralize staking offers, and you need that alternative to be competitive enough to actually meet that demand so that the absolute share of centralized actors represented in state distribution doesn't grow at least is crucial. So how do you make it competitive? Well, I guess there are two things about this. The first one is that it needs to be able to scale with a demand for taking and not be limited by kind its internal way of dealing with a stake. That's mostly relevant to Ethereum, but it's also relevant to Cosmos. You want your product to be able to scale, that might include you being able to onboard new zones quickly  although that's probably not where you'll find the most competition from the most centralized actors because they take a while before they list new chains, but anyway you need the protocol to scale, you need to have a perfect token, a good derivative that is well integrated so that people want to have this token, use it, hold it, and you need the validator set underneath to be robust, and that's for multiple reasons. The first one is that if your validator set management is really bad, you're going to hurt the network and so either you are going to destroy the network, you're participating in thereby also destroying your value or the network itself in its community will react before that happens hopefully and will either fork you out or find a way to stop you from hurting the network. So the first thing and the second thing is that your token is only as good as your validator set because if you have a shitty validator set with tons of validators who get jailed and others who get slashed, the APR of your liquid second derivative is not going to be competitive and it might even go negative if you're really bad. So to sustain a good token you need a good validator set and have all of these things that can contribute to improving the concentration of the state. So that's on the liquid staking. In terms of the way we do blockchains in general I think having lower requirements to become a validator is a good thing. We see on Etherium that the 32 Eth requirement has been a tremendous barrier to smaller validators which have been Ethereum. His vision of Ethereum should be evaluated  eventually. It should run on your phone. We're going to make it as lightweight as possible. I think this vision has tremendous value though Ethereum is very far from that state right now, and I think in Cosmos we have to deal with the limitations of tendermint which is now as you increase the size of the set you increase latency and it stops working so efficiently. So that's one of the main hiccups there, and so in the meantime, before we figure out a way that we can have no larger sets, which would be nice, there are interesting initiatives like cyborg a couple of months back led this initiative where they were trying to make some ranking of various interfaces so that people would have access to differentiated tools and differentiated lists of validators with different profiles so that people can select validators based on their priorities without having three years of research. I think that's really the key point, you need the information to be available, and you need people to have access to it as easily as possible because the barrier the difference between staking with a liquid it a centralized provider and staking on your own is already massive and so we need to do everything that we can to make it as easy as possible whilst providing as much information as possible but also recognizing that it will most probably never be possible to actually give all of the relevant information publicly because some of the information that is relevant to actually making rational decisions about who to stake with is information that is really critical to the validators business for example which direct jurisdiction are they under, which country are they in, which server they use, what's their set up. That might be the best practice that should be shared, but you also might see it as a competitive advantage. If you have a better setup that is more efficient then you don't really want to share that information necessarily and so for various reasons like their personal safety, the safety of their business or their competitive advantage, or even the security of their infrastructure because for all these reasons validator will most probably not be fully comfortable sharing all of the information that is required to make a dedicated decision. Even if they did, most people would not have the time to actually go that in-depth, make charts about where the validators are distributed in the world, and then aggregate stake based on this. This is not something that is available to just anyone. I guess I'm somewhat deep in the context, I would still not be able to do that, so it's unrealistic to expect people to go that deep. </p>
<p>[00:23:40] Citizen Cosmos: It's interesting that we came to that from that question because in Citizen Cosmos one of the targets and goals that we have is to try, and we have the biggest databases. I'm talking about interviews with the top founders of validators and asking about their motivation. Not just what's their setting and setup, because these are private questions that lead to security issues but looking at those blockchains as digital nations and looking at those validators as businesses who build on those nations, then I want to know as the citizen of that nation what is this business building in my nation. I want to know whether this business is building an atomic bomb in there or whether they're putting that money back into work, for example building an IMM Zone which would benefit me more and that's what we try to go into, and especially when we have validators, we have now a separate thing. We do streams with validators where we try to get their profile but you're right that people have no time to listen to an hour-long interview. It's a big balance of weights, it is hard to understand which way it goes. 
Let's get back in a slightly different angle and talk a little bit more about Neutron and a little
bit more about the major topics out there. I’m going to quote Neutron’s Twitter. It says “permissionless CosmWasm gateway. Could you explain what it is? </p>
<p>[00:26:05] Spaydh: That's a good question. So CosmWasm is a virtual machine, it's basically a way that your blockchain can take pieces of code that have been written by other people that are not directly in the blockchain itself and run them to produce products and services or make a pretty pictures or whatever you want. The interesting thing about Cosmos is that it's a module that you can put into your blockchain and so that module you can choose for it to be permissioned or permissionless. If you’re permissioned, that means that for somebody to deploy a piece of code that can get executed in that virtual machine, they have to go through governance first. That is usually seen as a way to either improve the security of the zone by having some people review the code before it's deployed or a way to only select the protocols that complement your zone the best, which makes a lot of sense especially for app chains. Osmosis is doing it and makes perfect sense, it doesn't need to have a very complex DeFi protocol that has nothing to do with their trading engine and so what they want is to have other programs that come and complement very closely and make symbiosis with their main product. Essentially the permissionless version of it is that anyone can come and work on your small contract, you're ready to deploy it while you can deploy it on your own you make a few transactions, and then your contract starts existing on the blockchain. The point here is that we're building a whole ecosystem, not just one product that we want to complement with plugins. We want to give anybody access to the IBC technologies that allow you to interact with other blockchains very closely. So because of it, there is very little sense for us in asking people to go through the loops of governance, presenting the whole thing. They can release a smart 
contract, if they found vulnerabilities in them, they can migrate them to a new version where they patch it. They don't have to wait two weeks or whatever governance delay in between. And so if they improve their product or if they fix issues can just iterate and get better. Essentially,  over time and the overhead in terms of the developer experience is much lower. Now, the gateway to IBC part means that there are a few ideas but one of them is that building an app chain today is much easier than ever, but it's still not a trivial amount of work. You need to learn how the Cosmos works and the rest down the line if you want to have small contracts and bootstrap your validator set and the market cap of your token so that your zone is secure, etc. There are a ton of considerations, and if you don't need an app chain or don't have the means to have an app chain, then you can still enter Cosmos by just releasing a smart contract on Neutron. So it's a gateway because it is an easier way to enter a Cosmos than spending up your whole blockchain. However, it's also a gateway because once you're on Neutron, you still get access to all the technologies that app chains enjoy. Also, to all of the other zones that IBC connects, not only can you transfer tokens, you can also execute transactions on every ICA blockchain, but can also retrieve data from any IBC blockchain. So you can come to Cosmos on Neutron and enjoy the full 
ecosystem. </p>
<p>[00:29:36] Citizen Cosmos: It's interesting that you mentioned several things while explaining the interesting accounts and queries. I think Neutron is mentioned in the white paper 2.0 of Atom. Was that deliberate? Were you guys waiting to build those things? Were you trying to align the release of the protocol and the tesnet’s active nets with the release of the
white paper? Or were you just piling the good technologies and putting them all together?</p>
<p>[00:26:05] Spaydh: No, actually, we had zero visibility into the progress of Atom 2.0 to point itself just like any other cosmonauts we were looking forward to it because exciting ways that aligned with Cosmos vision to drive value to Atom is kind of an interesting topic, but at the same
time we weren't actively involved in it, we didn't have an idea of the timeline, so we didn't build our road map with that in mind. The main thing for us was interchain security because we didn't want to launch on our own value set and then fire that validator set and then go to the validator set of the Cosmos Hub we wanted to be intersecured from the start. So if we built our roadmap around anything, it's most probably intersecurity. Now, in terms of Atom 2.0, I think
that there's a lot of potentials. Obviously, there are a lot of risks as well. That amount of money if it's misappropriated or if the government system is that control it is poorly designed, there are a lot of bad things that could happen. At the same time, if we get it right, implement the right systems, and come to a consensus about how this will work, then I think there's tremendous potential. The allocator, for example, is something that synergizes tremendously well with Neutron because, essentially, you can have the Hub that has an enormous treasury, and that treasury can be deployed to bootstrap the best projects and products or even create different systems that would not be possible in other circumstances because the actors that would benefit from these systems would not have access to that amount of capital. For example, you can allow a money market to re-hypothecate the collateral by liquid staking that collateral. The problem is when the collateral needs to be recalled, then you have a 21 day, you need to unstake and then that takes 21 or you need to sell to the market but you might not get price parity so you might actually take losses on your rehabilitation that's something that you want to avoid, and so what can be done here is that potentially that protocle could take a loan from the allocator for some capita, keep it as not staked tokens into price stability module and
then when they need to unwind the positions they basically swap through this at price parity and then what the module does is just that it unstakes and then waits to 21 days and then it gets essentially all the tokens back but the protocole is able to generate more revenue without increasing the risk and the price parity is not taking on risk either because it's just unstaking stuff and waiting and the Cosmos Hub itself is getting an interest rate on that capital that has been deployed and so as long as the money market is able to generate more than the interest rate charged by the locator then that's a benefit for everybody, the Hub gets money, the product gets money, Neutron gets transaction fees so everybody is happy basically. </p>
<p>[00:33:10] Citizen Cosmos: Do you think the interchange allocator will help make chains more community pools rather than chains more sustainable in the long run? What I mean is that a few years ago, there were a lot of examples where we saw DAOs buying DAOs with one project swapping with another project, tokens inside a community pool and that, in my opinion, makes the community pool a bit more sustainable because it's a bit more diversified then now instead of having just IBC or just Atom in the community pool and be open to the risks of a bear market. Let's say, in five years when the chain is much bigger in terms of decentralization, and the community will only sustain a certain amount of money. That money is only an Atom, and a bear market happens. Of course, we're going to have trouble because the price of Atom is fallen. It's not diversified enough. A good example is what is happening now. If the Atom community was to diversify the community pool during the bull market when Atom was at a higher price, the community pool currently could have a lot more money in it to develop the chain to feed more developers to feed more projects. So the question is: what features like the interchange allocator could it help to achieve with the abilities it has theoretically in an easier manner?</p>
<p>[00:34:46] Spaydh: I think it makes sense. It depends on diversifying. Selling some of the tokens of a zone during the peak of the bull market, ideally to stablecoins makes sense because these are not going to decrease in value when the bear market comes but diversifying to other tokens from other projects, I don't think is very efficient in terms of protecting the value of the community pool in terms of a bear market for the simple reasons that most assets in crypto are very correlated. Most assets in Cosmos are even more correlated, so the same tide raises or lowers all ships. It is especially true since Atom is the most liquid, established token, so it might not suffer from the bear market as much as other least established project tokens. So, diversifying can be useful, but you need to do it carefully because you don't want to buy stable coins at the bottom of the bear market. So getting tokens from other projects into your community pool is a great thing to do, but not for protecting the value of your token and rather for establishing diplomatic relationships between projects. What you want to do is you want to have close alignment with the projects that you can energize with, and so one way you can do this is by making sure that they benefit from you, increasing in value, and you benefit from them increasing in value. So that’s the way I see it, not like a portfolio management thing. </p>
<p>[00:36:20] Citizen Cosmos: Although it wouldn't be that bad buying Atom or Ethereum at 10 cents. That would be a good purchase if you could do it.  The next question is, what would be, in your opinion, a good way to help community pools to cure value in the long run? Neutron is, as you mentioned, all about bringing value to not just its holders but to Atom and the Cosmos. So in your opinion, what could be those ways, or what are you guys planning to do in Neutron to cure that value and attract that value that will benefit everybody else? </p>
<p>[00:37:06] Spaydh: So I think right now we're in the phase where we're bootstrapping the ecosystem, and so that's the phase of a project where essentially your network doesn't have that many users and projects yet, and so the appeal of joining the network is fairly low. In traditional start-ups, we refer to this as the cold start problem when you need to start the engine, but you know it's not already running by itself, so it's much more difficult than just keeping it running so in this specific phase of the project most likely what we're going to do is we're going to give grants to projects that we think are promising to incentivize the first adopters, to start and build the foundations of the system. It's likely that you will have some very fundamental primitives. One of the models that makes sense for bootstrapping a zone is choosing a team that you can trust, that has demonstrated their abilities already built interesting products or even preferably built that kind of product, a team that, by doing your due diligence, you have a fairly high confidence that they will deliver something incredible. Then you give them a significant amount of the zone tokens. These tokens would be locked for investing for a long period but they get this incentive. So if you build these cool premises, other people develop and build on top of it. Then, not only am I generating a business that hopefully makes sense and is profitable, but I'm also creating value for the zone. Because I have a large stake in the zone, that will also be profitable. But those strategic protocols should be removable by governments, and that should be something that should be known and well said from the beginning. So the incentive you're creating here is that if you do a great job and build this zone up and build the protocol up, then you’re going to get rich, and if you fuck up or underdeliver, then I'm going to lose all of the things that haven't been paid back to you. So it's not like we're not going to take back what you've already been paid because it's gradually investing. We can demonstrably show that you're not doing what you are supposed to do, which was building an incredible product then we can stop the relationship and then try to find somebody else who will do a better job by using those tokens again or just remove them and take them back to the community pool so that they can be used there. There are four ecosystems. In particular, there are a few fundamental premises that you need. You need a good dex, you need a good money market, you need a stablecoin, you need bridges to other interesting ecosystems, you need an NFT marketplace, and you need some way for DAOs to organize themselves. You probably need liquid staking because they make good collateral for many of these other use cases once you have this. You have a lot of Legos that people can build on top of and create more interesting, complex, or innovative products. So that's the way I see it in a nutshell. The first phases of Neutron will most probably be as a zone, as a project. We will probably need to incentivize a few incredible teams to build these foundations so that other people can come and experiment and make new innovative stuff. The other idea here is that Neutron as a protocol should reward people actively contributing value to it. We do this by proposing an incentives model where you know there are incentives in a pool. They can get distributed by governance to various protocols registered for a gauge. Once they receive these incentives, they have to be distributed in their entirety to the users, so they're not getting paid directly. The developers are only getting paid directly from there. They can get grants and stuff, but they're not getting paid with incentives. What we're doing is that we helping them bootstrap the adoption of their product which generates fees for them because they're monetizing their app. But we're also giving back value to the users, and that value will probably be using the ecosystem. That's what happens with incentives, and it's fine as long as the ecosystem itself is growing and we're building an infrastructure that will make it competitive in the long run. There are very interesting mechanisms here. The gauge system itself is a mind funk, but that's what I'm working on right now, so all that I've said and a lot more that we haven't discussed yet apply to this phase of your bootstrapping zone. That doesn't apply, for example, to the Cosmos Hub and Osmosis because they already have well-established positions in the market. They should be protecting their tokens and only allocating the tokens where they're getting a large return on deployment. So they're not leaking out value everywhere; they should only be focused on growing the parts of the protocol that makes the most sense and that produces a better user experience, more revenue for the state holders, etc. </p>
<p>[00:42:21] Citizen Cosmos: It's interesting that you went into bootstrapping zones because one of the next questions I had was specifically about that. It's interesting how
blockchain projects get launched from a general perspective. From your experience being a community manager and then a cringe manager, as you wrote on your Twitter. </p>
<p>[00:43:20] Spaydh: My title is deputy general manager, but my actual title is chief chief LARP officer. </p>
<p>[00:43:35] Citizen Cosmos: Yeah, that’s cool. I was a manager looking busy. So, back to the question. How was that experience? What would you suggest to somebody that just getting involved in it? What would you say not to ever do?</p>
<p>[00:43:20] Spaydh: This is a trillion-dollar question! The topic is very complex and very unique  to every project and the context in which they are built, the type of communities and developers that they appeal to, etc. There is no size fits all recipe.  In 2021 we saw that large incentives programs seem to work at bootstrapping, having protocols on the zones. We've also seen now that a lot of the activity on a lot of blockchains that had these programs like Avalanche and  Venom, unfortunately for these ecosystems left so I think it's a tremendously tricky question. I think there are multiple approaches to trying to find the solution that is going to work best. I think first you need to have a good understanding of what has been tried before, you need to try and
identify what worked, what didn't work, and which context these solutions were applied to. For example, the Ethereum story of the whole thing bootstrapping itself is one likely to repeat itself at scale because there is so much competition right now, why would you devote all your time with no expectation of an upside to building something on a completely new ecosystem when there are multiple good ones on the sides with whatever language you want to code in like Cosmos or Solidity? This doesn't seem likely to happen again, so I think you need to learn from what happened before and try to take it into account, and that's why for Neutron we want to have the incentive program to be inside the blockchain itself and managed by the community itself so that it can adjust over time to the circumstances that it's faced with. We're trying our best. We're trying everything possible to make sure that Neutron will be successful at the same time, you can never guarantee that these things will be, and so that’s the same problem that every founder or every person launching a new project will face. You have to evaluate the market honestly to find out if there is a need for what you're building. Usually, you only start building your thesis. Our thesis is that there is a need for smart contracts that exist across multiple blockchains and allow applications to behave cross-blockchains just as if they were one whilst being secure. You can never know, you can just try and learn from the past, try to find, and improve those systems and implement them in a way that makes sense so that perhaps you know you're building the next Ethereum. </p>
<p>[00:47:15] Citizen Cosmos: I'll give you a small blitz. Give me three projects outside the top twenty that you're interested in. They don't have to be blockchains. </p>
<p>[00:48:24] Spaydh: So I think what the Anoma team has been building is incredible. I also like what Bitcoin is doing with decentralized grants. That's a tremendous inspiration. And I really like
what DAODAO is doing as well. </p>
<p>[00:49:39] Citizen Cosmos: Second question. Name 2 things that motivate you in your daily
life. </p>
<p>[00:49:47] Spaydh: Learning stuff and coffee. </p>
<p>[00:50:00] Citizen Cosmos: Last one! Give me one person or a book that you recommend. </p>
<p>[00:50:21] Spaydh: Paolo Cohelo’s “The Alchemist” novel. </p>
<p>[00:50:28] Citizen Cosmos: Great book, I love it! That’s about it I guess, thanks a lot Spaydh!</p>
