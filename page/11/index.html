<p><a href="https://www.citizencosmos.space/cudos">The 66th episode</a> of Citizen Cosmos was dedicated to the <a href="https://www.cudos.org/">CUDOS project</a> - the decentralized cloud computing network. Among the topics discussed with <a href="https://twitter.com/hawkinstech?lang=en">Matt Hawkins</a>, the CEO of CUDOS, were crypto, mining, diversity of cloud computing projects, gaming, education, and many more. However, above all these topics stands the primary goal of CUDOS is sustainability and eco-friendliness. Therefore, we will discuss the data centers, their harmful impact on the ecology, and the ways of dealing with them. </p>
<p>Data centers, facilities that centralize an organization's shared IT operations and equipment to store, process, and disseminate data and applications, consume 3-7% of the world's electricity. In addition, data centers require 24/7 to keep their equipment running. As a result, the operation of the data center provokes greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. CO2 emissions are also results of data centers usage of computing power making it one of the most disturbing factors. Moreover, this does not even consider the impact of construction of the data center, which is also the sourse of various harmful emissions. To learn more about the carbon footprint the data centers and cloud computing leave, we recommend reading <a href="https://www.climatiq.io/blog/measure-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-data-centres-cloud-computing">Hessam Lavi's article</a> from Climatiq. </p>
<p><strong>PUE</strong> </p>
<p>As the problem of data centers’ harmful emissions is becoming more and more disturbing, many big and smaller companies are considering the PUE. PUE or Power Utilization Efficiency is a metric for evaluating the energy efficiency of a data center. PUE reflects the electrical energy consumed by the data center to the point consumed directly by the data center equipment. For example, if the data center receives 10 MW of power from the network and all equipment keeps at 5 MW, the PUE indicator will be 2. If the reading gap decreases, the coefficient will be 1, which is perfect. The PUE is globally used to understand which regions are affected mainly by the data centers' emissions. However, although the indicator may help some areas to start working on problem-solving, it might sometimes be unjust. For example, some data centers simply have worse climatic conditions than others. So, to cool a conditional data center in South Africa, you need much more electricity than a data center in Iceland. The most energy inefficient data centers are in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and parts of the Asia-Pacific region. Europe and the area uniting the USA and Canada are among the leaders in terms of PUE. So how can the PUE be lowered, especially for the regions with a hot climate? </p>
<p><strong>Free cooling</strong></p>
<p>One of the ways to lower the PUE is free cooling. A significant percentage of energy consumed by data centers goes to operating artificial cooling systems. The implementation of free cooling is one of the ways to reduce the cost of this energy. The outside air is filtered, heated, cooled, and supplied into the server room. Exhaust hot air is thrown out or partially mixed with the incoming flow. The more outdoor air temperature is suitable for the data center hall, the less energy is needed to bring it to the desired condition.</p>
<p>Proper use of the capacity available in the data center can also contribute to energy efficiency. For example, the purchased servers should either work for the clients' tasks or consume minimal energy during downtime. One way to control the situation is to use infrastructure management software. For example, a data center infrastructure management system. This software automatically redistributes the server load, disables idle devices, and recommends the cooling fans' rotation speed. In addition, timely updating of equipment is an integral part of improving the data center's energy efficiency. For example, an outdated server is often inferior in performance and resource intensity to a new generation server. Therefore, to reduce PUE, it is recommended to update the equipment as often as possible. </p>
<p>Finally, the optimal way to lower PUE is to use virtual servers. They consume 80% less energy. It happens because putting more virtual servers on fewer physical machines incurs hardware maintenance, cooling, and power costs. In addition, virtualization allows reallocating virtual resources from processors to storage. Therefore, electricity is only used to ensure operation, and alternative energy sources improve energy efficiency. </p>
<p><strong>Particular actions</strong></p>
<p>Talking about CUDOS and their dedication to sustainability and reduction of carbon footprint, it is important to talk about their particular actions. Cudos offers scalable computing solutions that address two apparent possibilities. Firstly, the Cudos network is an l1 blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem. It uses a consensus system with delegated share confirmation (DPoS). At its core, PoS is also more careful about the environment. Therefore, it does not require energy for crypto mining, like the Proof of Work protocol. By communicating with other networks and providing data and computing oracles, the Cudos network can also effectively act as an l2 solution for other blockchains and solve scalability and throughput problems. Secondly, Cudo Ventures is working on creating a platform for automating the process of managing and trading unused computing power. Finally, it improves existing cloud service offerings regarding supply and demand for computing power. Thus, the Cudo solution will provide sustainability, economic rewards, and improved and personalized services. Ultimately, Cudo aims to connect them by giving them the first ever new Level 3. Furthermore, it will allow blockchain networks to seamlessly perform any computing work, integrating cloud and blockchain solutions into one. </p>
<p>Today, data centers are one of the most worrying sources of ecological problems. However, more and more companies are striving to make the data-keeping process as eco-friendly as possible regarding the PUE index. As we see even smaller companies like CUDOS getting involved in sustainability awareness, we can be sure that sooner or later, most data centers will be energy efficient. </p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.cc/jDKmY2Lt"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/t4VjPVbZ/ea9c8ebf-a4d9-492d-b423-e66bea9fa03a.png" alt="ea9c8ebf-a4d9-492d-b423-e66bea9fa03a.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The transition from centralization to decentralization</strong></p>
<p>Until recently, our world was primarily centralized. The priority form of government was, in most cases, a pyramidal structure. Decisions and orders descend from top to bottom. From bosses to subordinates, from corporate managers to branch directors, from the central bank to banks, from the president to ministers, and on to the people. And although it is believed that democracy prevails in society, and all decisions are made based on a social contract, we all see perfectly well that critical decisions are made in a single center of concentration of power.</p>
<p><strong>However, blockchain has changed everything...</strong></p>
<p>Everything changed with the invention of blockchain technology (although some conspiracy theorists believe that this technology was given to us from above =)). Blockchain gradually entered our lives and changed our paradigm of thinking from centralized representations to decentralized ones. Blockchain has shown that it is possible to negotiate, make decisions and monitor their implementation without involving a single center of power. In the blockchain, all processes and management are open and belong directly to the community without intermediaries. Therefore, it is quite attractive, which is why the number of decentralized services proliferates.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralization in the wild</strong></p>
<p>A decentralized service is a distributed organism where each user is a part of one whole. As an example consider the forest as an example of a decentralized system of blockchains and interchains.</p>
<p>The tree blockchain interacts with the grass blockchain and the squirrel blockchain. Many decentralized ecosystems in the forest are interconnected by bridges and send transactions to each other. The kingdom of mushrooms alone is worth something.</p>
<p>The forest does not have a single control center. Instead, each part of it acts in its interests. Yet, all its elements are combined into a giant ecosystem and are naturally synchronized with each other.</p>
<p><strong>The idea</strong></p>
<p>In the same way, a group of people united by a common idea or having the same values ​​can join a community where there will be no chairperson, deputy, secretary, etc. The meaning in these positions disappears, and corruption opportunities are associated with them. Such communities can interact with other groups and communities as well as individuals. And the rules of these interactions and communications are equal. A smart contract monitors the fulfillment of the conditions of exchange and transactions. Regulators, notaries, and brokers are no longer needed. They are extra in this chain of interaction.</p>
<p>The idea of ​​decentralization is increasingly capturing the minds of people. The absence of a central governing body is so attractive that the number of new blockchains has recently been overgrowing. And the number of services built on these blockchains is growing even faster. Already today, we see such services as decentralized exchanges, decentralized finance and loans, decentralized data storage services, decentralized video hosting (https://bastyon.org), instant messengers (https://usedust.com), and even social networks (http://twister.net.co). And in the future, entire states based on the blockchain may appear.</p>
<p>Which decentralized services are you lacking?</p>
